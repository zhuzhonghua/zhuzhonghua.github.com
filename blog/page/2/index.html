<p>译者：<a href="http://www.sophiazheng.com">郑思</a> 转载请注明</p>

<p>这篇文章脱胎于我跟几个程序员的聊天：为什么Java总让人感觉奇怪？先声明，本文绝无批判Java之意，这可是一篇关于黑客嗅觉的案例研究。</p>

<p>日积月累，黑客们逐渐进化出神秘而敏锐的嗅觉，他们能闻出愉悦身心的好技术，也能辨出乏味技术的臭味儿。</p>

<p>我想，试着思考为什么Java散发出一种令人不快的气味，并将述诸文字，或许会很有趣。</p>

<p>一些读者觉得我的尝试挺有趣，毕竟，我写的东西之前还没人写过。还有一些人建议，最好还是别去碰我不懂的领域，不然我会引火烧身。因此，让我再次澄清一下，下文的主题并不是Java（天哪，这门语言我竟然从来都没码过！），而是黑客的嗅觉（对此我深思熟虑，想了不少）。</p>

<p>格言有云：“不可从封面妄自揣测书的内容。”这句话语出有典。有段时期，为了满足不同书商的不同品位，书籍以定制的平装硬皮封面装订。在那些日子里，你无法从封面上辨别一本书。但是，出版业大大地发展了，现今出版商正致力于让你一眼就能从门面上看出书里讲了些什么。</p>

<p>我在书店花了很多时间，我觉得，自己似乎明白了出版商想要通过一本书告诉我的。我没花在书店的时间，大部分都花在电脑前。我同意，在某种程度上，我学会了通过技术的门面去辨别技术的含量。</p>

<p>这或许仅仅是运气，但是我还是成功地从不少技术手中给自己赢得了时间，那些技术已被证明不过是个臭蛋。</p>

<p>到目前为止，Java对我来说看上去都挺像个臭蛋。</p>

<p>我的程序没有一个是用Java写成的，从来没有看过Java的参考书。尽管如此，我还是有一种预感，那就是，Java不会成为一门非常成功的语言。未来或许将揭示我的愚蠢；企图预测科技的走向是门危险的生意。但是，我愿意写下为什么我不喜欢Java的门面，当做时间胶囊，交由未来检验。</p>

<p>1、Java炒作过度。实际标准却没有得到提升。没有人不得不推动C语言，或Unix 又或HTML。一个真正的标准趋势在大多数人听到它之前，往往已经建立了。在黑客第六感的扫描仪里，Perl与Java一样伟大，甚至要伟大的多，仅仅是凭借它自身的语言优势。</p>

<p>2、Java的目标很低。Gosling明确地说，Java为使用C语言的程序员而设计，设计的并不难。设计该门语言的目标是，让它成为另一个C++。C从更高级的语言中提取了一些概念。就像Sitcom的创建者，又或垃圾食品、三天两夜游的创建者那样，Java语言的创建者有意识地为一群不如他们聪明的人设计了一个产品。从历史上来说，那些为其他人使用的语言下场很惨淡：cobol、PL/I, Pascal, Ada,C++。优秀的语言都为自己的创建器所设计：比如C、Perl，Smalltalk，Lisp。</p>

<p>3、Java别有有心。有人曾经说过，如果人们只在有话要说的时候，才写书，而不是在他们想写的时候写书，世界将会美好得多。诚如此言，我们在大多数时间里听到Java，并不是因为它是一门编程语言，而是因为它是Sun打破微软统治地位的战略计划的一部分。</p>

<p>4、没有程序员喜欢Java。C语言、Perl、Python、Smalltalk还有Lisp的程序员都喜欢自己所使用的语言。我还没听人说过他们发自内心热爱Java。</p>

<p>【2001年就有Python了？我勒个去。无知家庭主妇再次被震撼了。】</p>

<p>5、人们被迫使用Java。我认识一些使用Java的人，他们使用Java出于被迫。要么是用Java写的程序容易融到资金，要么是客户希望他们用Java编写程序，要么是管理人员让他们使用Java。这些人都是聪明人。假如某项技术很不错，他们绝对会二话不说，主动采用。</p>

<p>6、设计Java的人太多了。最好的编程语言通常都是由开发的小团体设计出来的。而Java似乎是由某个委员会运行管理的。如果时间证明Java是门不错的语言，这将是历史上头一个由委员会设计出优秀语言。</p>

<p>7、Java带着官僚主义的习性。凭我对Java浅薄的了解，该门语言在执行时有许多协议。一门好的语言真的不需如此。好语言让你能做出你想要的东西，还不会挡你的路。</p>

<p>8、Java是个伪君子。 现在，Sun假设Java就是基层，努力让Java看上去像Perl或Python，是一门开源语言。实际上，它在巨型公司的控制之下。因此，这门语言的单调乏味与一家大公司如出一辙。</p>

<p>9、Java为大型企业而设计。大型组织与黑客的目标并不相同。大型企业需要适合于平庸程序员组成的大型团队所使用的语言。这样的语言拥有速度限制，防止傻瓜损害他们的进度，就好像跟在U型牵引卡车后面。而黑客们只想要权力。历史上，为大型机构设计的语言（PL/I, Ada)输给了黑客们所使用的语言（C，perl). 原因: 今日的年轻黑客就是明日的CTO。</p>

<p>10、喜欢Java的人有问题。基本上，我所钦佩的程序员没有一个人喜欢Java。谁喜欢Java？那些身穿西服的商务人士，他们甚至不懂一门语言与另一门语言的差别，但他们了解，他们持续不断地听到Java的名字；大公司的程序员，他们看到有比C + +更好语言就会惊讶；还有叽叽喳喳的本科生，他们随时准备喜欢上一门帮助他们得到工作的语言（考试究竟会考些什么？）。这些人的意见跟风摇摆。</p>

<p>11、Java的父公司已经风烛残年。Sun的商业模式在两方面都遭到了削弱。与台式机使用同一类型的英特尔处理器很便宜，而且运行速度也足够当服务器了。作为Solaris服务器操作系统，FreeBSD似乎是个不错的开放系统。Sun的广告暗示，你需要工业强度的Sun服务器。如果广告是真的，那么雅虎该第一个买下Sun。但我在那里工作的时候，这里服务器不过是使用了FreeBSD的英特尔盒。Sun的未来大有问题。如果Sun的运行陷入困境，Java也会被拖下水。</p>

<p>12、国防部喜欢Java。国防部鼓励开发人员使用Java。这在我看来，这糟的不能再糟了。国防部保卫国家的工作干得很不赖（虽然价格不菲），但他们喜欢计划、程序和协议。他们的文化是黑客文化的对立面; 软件的问题上，他们往往会赌错。上一次，国防部最喜欢的编程语言是Ada。</p>

<p>记住，本文对Java的内容并未置评，但我批评了它的门面。我对Java了解不多，因此谈不上喜欢或不喜欢。上文讲述了我丝毫不渴望了解它的原因。</p>

<p>本文可能看起来稍显傲慢，因为我在了解语言之前，就甚至试图评论它。但是，这是所有程序员都必须做的事情。我们有太多的技术，不可能每样都学习。你要学会花时间从外在的迹象判断，这一门技巧是否值得你花时间学习。我也同样傲慢地放弃了COBOL，ADA，Visual Basic，IBM AS400，VRML，ISO 9000，SET协议，VMS系统，Novell NetWare与CORBA等等。它们只是看起来很可疑。</p>

<h1>我对Java的判断可能并不正确。它或许是一门由某个大公司扳倒竞争对手的语言；是由委员会设计、符合“主流”口味、捧到天上的语言；是一门被国防部宠爱的语言，同时仍然是一个整洁，优美，功能强大的语言，让我发自内心地喜欢用它编程。确有此种可能。但看上去可能甚微。</h1>

<p>Java&#8217;s Cover April 2001</p>

<p>This essay developed out of conversations I&#8217;ve had with several other programmers about why Java smelled suspicious. It&#8217;s not a critique of Java! It is a case study of hacker&#8217;s radar.</p>

<p>Over time, hackers develop a nose for good (and bad) technology. I thought it might be interesting to try and write down what made Java seem suspect to me.</p>

<p>Some people who&#8217;ve read this think it&#8217;s an interesting attempt to write about something that hasn&#8217;t been written about before. Others say I will get in trouble for appearing to be writing about things I don&#8217;t understand. So, just in case it does any good, let me clarify that I&#8217;m not writing here about Java (which I have never used) but about hacker&#8217;s radar (which I have thought about a lot).</p>

<p>The aphorism &#8220;you can&#8217;t tell a book by its cover&#8221; originated in the times when books were sold in plain cardboard covers, to be bound by each purchaser according to his own taste. In those days, you couldn&#8217;t tell a book by its cover. But publishing has advanced since then: present-day publishers work hard to make the cover something you can tell a book by.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time in bookshops and I feel as if I have by now learned to understand everything publishers mean to tell me about a book, and perhaps a bit more. The time I haven&#8217;t spent in bookshops I&#8217;ve spent mostly in front of computers, and I feel as if I&#8217;ve learned, to some degree, to judge technology by its cover as well. It may be just luck, but I&#8217;ve saved myself from a few technologies that turned out to be real stinkers.</p>

<p>So far, Java seems like a stinker to me. I&#8217;ve never written a Java program, never more than glanced over reference books about it, but I have a hunch that it won&#8217;t be a very successful language. I may turn out to be mistaken; making predictions about technology is a dangerous business. But for what it&#8217;s worth, as a sort of time capsule, here&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t like the look of Java:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It has been so energetically hyped. Real standards don&#8217;t have to be promoted. No one had to promote C, or Unix, or HTML. A real standard tends to be already established by the time most people hear about it. On the hacker radar screen, Perl is as big as Java, or bigger, just on the strength of its own merits.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s aimed low. In the original Java white paper, Gosling explicitly says Java was designed not to be too difficult for programmers used to C. It was designed to be another C++: C plus a few ideas taken from more advanced languages. Like the creators of sitcoms or junk food or package tours, Java&#8217;s designers were consciously designing a product for people not as smart as them. Historically, languages designed for other people to use have been bad: Cobol, PL/I, Pascal, Ada, C++. The good languages have been those that were designed for their own creators: C, Perl, Smalltalk, Lisp.</p></li>
<li><p>It has ulterior motives. Someone once said that the world would be a better place if people only wrote books because they had something to say, rather than because they wanted to write a book. Likewise, the reason we hear about Java all the time is not because it has something to say about programming languages. We hear about Java as part of a plan by Sun to undermine Microsoft.</p></li>
<li><p>No one loves it. C, Perl, Python, Smalltalk, and Lisp programmers love their languages. I&#8217;ve never heard anyone say that they loved Java.</p></li>
<li><p>People are forced to use it. A lot of the people I know using Java are using it because they feel they have to. Either it&#8217;s something they felt they had to do to get funded, or something they thought customers would want, or something they were told to do by management. These are smart people; if the technology was good, they&#8217;d have used it voluntarily.</p></li>
<li><p>It has too many cooks. The best programming languages have been developed by small groups. Java seems to be run by a committee. If it turns out to be a good language, it will be the first time in history that a committee has designed a good language.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s bureaucratic. From what little I know about Java, there seem to be a lot of protocols for doing things. Really good languages aren&#8217;t like that. They let you do what you want and get out of the way.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s pseudo-hip. Sun now pretends that Java is a grassroots, open-source language effort like Perl or Python. This one just happens to be controlled by a giant company. So the language is likely to have the same drab clunkiness as anything else that comes out of a big company.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s designed for large organizations. Large organizations have different aims from hackers. They want languages that are (believed to be) suitable for use by large teams of mediocre programmers&#8211; languages with features that, like the speed limiters in U-Haul trucks, prevent fools from doing too much damage. Hackers don&#8217;t like a language that talks down to them. Hackers just want power. Historically, languages designed for large organizations (PL/I, Ada) have lost, while hacker languages (C, Perl) have won. The reason: today&#8217;s teenage hacker is tomorrow&#8217;s CTO.</p></li>
<li><p>The wrong people like it. The programmers I admire most are not, on the whole, captivated by Java. Who does like Java? Suits, who don&#8217;t know one language from another, but know that they keep hearing about Java in the press; programmers at big companies, who are amazed to find that there is something even better than C++; and plug-and-chug undergrads, who are ready to like anything that might get them a job (will this be on the test?). These people&#8217;s opinions change with every wind.</p></li>
<li><p>Its daddy is in a pinch. Sun&#8217;s business model is being undermined on two fronts. Cheap Intel processors, of the same type used in desktop machines, are now more than fast enough for servers. And FreeBSD seems to be at least as good an OS for servers as Solaris. Sun&#8217;s advertising implies that you need Sun servers for industrial strength applications. If this were true, Yahoo would be first in line to buy Suns; but when I worked there, the servers were all Intel boxes running FreeBSD. This bodes ill for Sun&#8217;s future. If Sun runs into trouble, they could drag Java down with them.</p></li>
<li><p>The DoD likes it. The Defense Department is encouraging developers to use Java. This seems to me the most damning sign of all. The Defense Department does a fine (though expensive) job of defending the country, but they love plans and procedures and protocols. Their culture is the opposite of hacker culture; on questions of software they will tend to bet wrong. The last time the DoD really liked a programming language, it was Ada.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Bear in mind, this is not a critique of Java, but a critique of its cover. I don&#8217;t know Java well enough to like it or dislike it. This is just an explanation of why I don&#8217;t find that I&#8217;m eager to learn it.</p>

<p>It may seem cavalier to dismiss a language before you&#8217;ve even tried writing programs in it. But this is something all programmers have to do. There are too many technologies out there to learn them all. You have to learn to judge by outward signs which will be worth your time. I have likewise cavalierly dismissed Cobol, Ada, Visual Basic, the IBM AS400, VRML, ISO 9000, the SET protocol, VMS, Novell Netware, and CORBA, among others. They just smelled wrong.</p>

<p>It could be that in Java&#8217;s case I&#8217;m mistaken. It could be that a language promoted by one big company to undermine another, designed by a committee for a &#8220;mainstream&#8221; audience, hyped to the skies, and beloved of the DoD, happens nonetheless to be a clean, beautiful, powerful language that I would love programming in. It could be, but it seems very unlikely.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.paulgrahamcn.com/article/lispinweb">互联网程序中的lisp</a></p>

<p>互联网程序中的lisp</p>

<p>摘录自2001年4月在剑桥，MA的BBNlabs所作演讲
理想的语言</p>

<p>一个使用lisp写互联网程序的原因是：你“能”使用lisp。 当你写下一个只会在个人服务器上运行的程序时，你想用什么语言，就用什么语言。</p>

<p>在很长一段时间里，并没有太多语言可供撰写应用程序的程序员选择。编写应用程序意味着编写运行在桌面上的软件。 有一种固执的偏见认为，桌面软件必须使用与操作系统相同的语言编写。 例如，十年前，所有的应用程序都是用C语言撰写的。</p>

<p>现在，基于Web的应用使得上述情况发生了改变。只要你控制得了服务器， 你就可以用任何你想用的语言来写软件。这对你来说心安理得：因为你同时拥有操作系统和编译器的源代码。 如果语言与操作系统之间出了问题，你可以自己修复。</p>

<p>然而，新的自由是一把双刃剑。自由意味着你必须做出选择。 在以前，选择语言很容易。如果你是一个软件项目的负责人，而有些讨厌的家伙建议你使用一种你从来没用的语言来写软件，你只需对他们说：“那种语言一点儿也不实用，”就能结束争论。</p>

<p>现在，基于互联网的应用改变了一切。此刻，你对语言的选择权不得不屈服于市场的力量。 如果你还想对这股改变的趋势装作视而不见，还使用c或c++， 就像我们竞争对手的选择一样，那你就是在准备被时代抛弃。创业小公司只有使用更强大的语言才能制胜。</p>

<p>渐进式开发</p>

<p>使用lisp语言开发的软件带着某种开发风格。它的传统之一是采用渐进式的发展：尽快开始编写程序，越快越好，哪怕该程序暂时什么事情也完成不了。然后逐渐为程序添加主要功能，每一次改写之前的代码还能继续运行。</p>

<p>我觉得，这种编写方式让你迅速高效地编写出软件。 Lisp能将迅速高效的工作方式带入了使用它编写出的程序里，因为Lisp程序员已经这么工作了30年之久。</p>

<p>Viaweb编辑器是一个典型的渐进开发的产物。它始于一个120行的小程序，目的是为了生成网站。在我刚刚写完的一本书里的需要以网站为例子，于是我写了Viaweb。 最终，Viaweb编辑器成长为有约25,000行代码的程序。 我并不认为我有一两天时间能让停止现有代码，好让自己坐下来，改写所有代码。</p>

<p>整个开发过程是一个逐渐变化的长期过程。 这种发展方式非常符合网络程序的滚动发行方式。 这也是更高效的泛型编程方法。</p>

<p>互动的TopLevel</p>

<p>Lisp的互动TopLevel有助于快速开发软件。 但对我们而言，Lisp最大的优势或许是发掘bug。 正如我之前所说，在网络程序中，用户数据存储在你的服务器上，通常会不断重现出bug。</p>

<p>当客服拿着编辑器的错误报告来找我的时候，我会把Lisp代码装入解释器中，并以用户的账号登陆。 如果我能重现错误，我会中断循环，看看到底问题出在哪里。 通常，我可以立即修复错误，并发布一个修复补丁。 当我说“立即”，我的意思是，投诉的用户还没有挂断他的手机呢。</p>

<p>迅速修复错误为我们占据了相当有利的竞争地位。 如果我们能够快速找到并修正错误，而用户仍在讲电话， 我们就给用户成功留下了这一印象：程序的错误不过是他们自己想象出来的罢了。所以，有时我们告诉客服，请让用户重新登录，检查一下问题是否存在。 当然，等用户重新登录，他们使用的已经是新发布的版本了，错误早已修复，程序运行良好。 我知道这么做有点“卑鄙”，但同时也很有趣。</p>

<p>HTML的宏</p>

<p>Lisp的宏是我们的另一制胜点。我们在viaweb编辑器中广泛的使用了宏。 准确地描述，我们所使用的是一个“大宏”。我们非常依赖lisp；而宏会告诉你这种依赖究竟达到了何种程度。 因为，根本没有其他语言能拥有这样的宏。</p>

<p>一个我们使用宏的目的是生成HTML。宏与HTML彼此有种天然的默契。因为HTML是一个前缀表达式，这一点很像Lisp。HTML是递归的，这一点也很像Lisp。 因此，我们能在宏调用中调用宏，从生成最复杂的HTML，并且进程仍然可控。</p>

<p>嵌入语言</p>

<p>我们使用宏的另一大用途是嵌入语言——我们称其为Rtml。 （关于Rtml究竟代表些什么，解释版本不一。其实我是以Robert Morris的名字为它命名的。Rober Morris是Viaweb的共同创始人，他的用户名是Rtm）(Robert Morris, the other founder of Viaweb, whose username is Rtm.) 。我们软件的每一页面都是由RTML所写的程序生成的。 我们将这些程序称为模版，这样听起来就没那么吓人。其实，它们是如假包换的Lisp程序。Rtml是一个宏与内置的Lisp操作符的组合。</p>

<p>用户可以编写自己的Rtml模板，来实现他们所期望的网页外观。 我们生成了一个结构编辑器来操纵模板，这个编辑器很像用户在Interlisp中所使用的结构化编辑器。 对用户来说，他不必在自由模式下输入，只需要把现成的代码剪切、粘贴起来即可，不必担心语法错误。 这同时意味着，我们不需要显示底层的S表达式的括号：我们通过缩进来表示。 这样，这门语言就更易懂了。</p>

<p>我们特意设计Rtml，让它避免了运行错误： 每个Rtml程序都会生成一些网页，你可以不断调试网页，直至最后生成你想要的前端效果。</p>

<p>最开始，我们设想我们的用户是网站顾问，还设想他们会频繁使用Rtml。 因此，我们提供了不少默认模板，内含分块与项目网页等等， 目的是用户可以使用、修改，从而生成他想要的页面。</p>

<p>事实上，网络顾问并不喜欢Viaweb。顾问们，通常来说，都喜欢使用一般人很难上手的产品，这才能保证顾问会得到持续雇佣。 顾问们会访问我们的网站，发现我们的软件很容易使用， 它能让任何人在五分钟内建立起网上商店，他们便会说，我怎么可能用这么简单的玩意儿呢？ 因此，我们没在顾问身上赚到钱。相反，用户大部分都是终端用户，他们自己就是商人。 他们喜欢设计自己网站的感觉。他们不想学编程。他们只使用默认模板。</p>

<p>因此，Rtml最终没有变成程序的主界面。 它扮演了两个角色。首先，对于老练的用户来说，Rtml是只安全阀，提供完成内置模板无法提供的功能。在做viaweb的过程中，有人提出了一个相当有用的意见：用户始终希望升级，即使他们永远不会真的去用。 Rtml就是我们的升级路线。如果你想，你就能绝对控制您网页的每一个角落。</p>

<p>几百个用户中只有一个人会真的撰写自己的模板。这就提供给Rtml第二个优势。 通过查看这些用户如何修改内置模板，我们就可以知道我们需要还能给他们添加些什么。 我们最终的目标是：用户不需要使用Rtml。我们的内置模板应该提供出人们想要的一切内容。 以新的视角来观察，Rtml担任了警告者，它告诉我们，软件中还缺些什么。</p>

<p>编写者——我们是从Rtml的第三个优点中受益最多的人。 即使我们是唯一使用Rtml的人，设计这门语言也值了。 在软件中设计这样的一个抽象层为我们挣得了竞争优势。 首先，它使我们软件的设计干净、简介。我们的竞争对手使用C或Perl代码生成网页，而我们拥有高层语言来生成网页，同时指定页面样式。 这使得代码更干净，更容易修改。 我已经提到过，网络程序是通过渐进式的修改来发布的，渐进式修改要求我们了解修改的严重性。通过将代码分层设计，我们能更优雅地处理修改。 底层修改（也就是修改Rtml本身）影响甚广，也很少发生，通常需要编程者深思熟虑。而修改上层（模板代码）可以快速执行，无需担心太多后果。</p>

<p>Rtml很像Lisp，主要由Lisp宏组成。它的在线编辑器操作S表达式。 当人们运行模板时，模板就被编译成lisp函数。</p>

<p>Rtml在很大程度上依赖于关键字参数，因为那时我一直在思考Common Lisp的关键字参数，这一部分颇为棘手。由于网络软件的发布方式，我们必须设计易修改的软件。 Rtml本身很容易修改，就像该软件的其他部分一样。 大多数Rtml操作符设计为采用关键字参数。这一设定帮了我们大忙。 如果我要添加一个操作符的行为方式，只需要添加一个新的关键字参数， 现有的模板仍然可用。少数的Rtml操作符没有采取关键字参数， 因为我没想到日后有改变这些操作符的需求，可是结果总让我悔不当初。 如果我能从头再来，我想修改的事情之一是，让一切Rtml操作符都采用关键字参数。</p>

<p>事实上，我们在编辑器里嵌入了好几门其他语言。 其中一门语言是用以描述图片的，我们并没有将其暴露给用户。 Viaweb包含由C语言撰写的图像生成器，能够接收对图像的描述、创建图像、 并返回它的URL。我们也是使用S表达式来描述这些图像的。</p>

<p>闭包模拟子程序</p>

<p>使用网页作为UI的问题之一，是web页面的无状态属性。 我们使用词法闭包来模拟子程序行为。 如果你理解延续，那么我们所做的事情可以解释为， 我们以延续传递风格编写软件。</p>

<p>当大多数网络软件生成一个页面上的链接时，往往设想， 假如用户点击该链接，那么程序将要调用该CGI脚本及其参数。 而我们的软件生成链接时，则设想假如用户点击该链接，程序将运行这段代码。 这一段代码可以是任意一段代码，可能（事实上，通常情况下）也可以包含任意变量，并从上下文获取值。</p>

<p>我们是通过宏做到这一点的。宏带着包含闭包的初始参数，紧跟着一段代码。 代码将通过一个唯一ID存储在全局散列表中，这段代码的输出将通过文中的代码生成，并出现在一个链接里，链接的url包含了散列键。假若链接被点击，我们的软件会找到并调用相应的代码，然后继续这一循环。假如代码是闭包，则引用其上下文。 我们飞快地编写了CGI脚本。</p>

<p>到目前为止，我所说的听起来还很空洞，所以让我给你举个例子， 感受一下这一技术带来的显著差异。</p>

<p>在网络程序中，用户经常需要编辑多属性的对象。多数属性都可以表示为表单域或菜单。 例如，假设你编辑的对象代表一个人，你可能得到一个域储存姓名； 一个选择职称的菜单框，等等。</p>

<p>现在，有些对象带有Color属性，我们该怎么办？ 假如沿用普通的CGI脚本，那么这些属性都将集中在一个表单里， 底部带着个”更新”按钮，这么一来操作就很麻烦了。 你也可以使用一个文本字段，让用户手动输入RGB值， 但终端用户都不喜欢这么操作。 要不然，你可以设置一个包含可选颜色的菜单，但你必须限制颜色的数量。又或者你可以提供标准的色彩表，那么你需要256个菜单项，每个菜单项的名字都需要独一无二的命名。</p>

<p>Viaweb能够将一个颜色作为样本来代表当前值， 并跟随一个“修改”按钮。假设用户点击“修改”按钮， 他们就会来到带有色彩表的页面进行选择。 选择后，他们可以回到编辑对象属性的页面，发现颜色已经改变。 这就是我所说的闭包模拟子程序行为。 看起来，软件让用户选择一个颜色，并返回。实际并非如此；程序生成一个新的CGI调用，但对用户而言，我们正在处理一个子程序。我们写代码的方式表达出，假如用户点击了链接，并前往颜色选择页面，最后返回原有页面。 我只举了我们使用该技术的一个例子。 总而言之，这一技术让我们的程序看起来远比竞争对手更复杂。</p>

<p>Lisp in Web-Based Applications</p>

<p>Paul Graham</p>

<p>(This is an excerpt of a talk given at BBN Labs in Cambridge, MA, in
April 2001.)</p>

<p>Any Language You Want</p>

<p>One of the reasons to use Lisp in writing Web-based applications
is that you <em>can</em> use Lisp.  When you&#8217;re writing software that is
only going to run on your own servers, you can use whatever language
you want.</p>

<p>For a long time programmers didn&#8217;t have a lot of choice about what
language to use for writing application programs.  Until recently,
writing application programs meant writing software to run on
desktop computers.  In desktop software there was a strong bias
toward writing the application in the same language as the operating
system.  Ten years ago, for all practical purposes, applications
were written in C.</p>

<p>With Web-based applications, that changes.  You control the servers,
and you can write your software in any language you want.  You can
take it for granted now that you have the source code of both your
operating system and your compilers.  If there does turn out to be
any kind of problem between the language and the OS, you can fix
it yourself.</p>

<p>This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however.  Having more
choices means that you now have to think about which choice to
make.  It was easier in the old days.  If you were in charge of a
software project, and some troublesome person suggested writing
the software in a different language from whatever you usually
used, you could just tell them that it would be impractical, and
that would be the end of it.</p>

<p>Now, with server-based applications, everything is changed.  You&#8217;re
now subject to market forces in what language you choose.  If you
try to pretend that nothing has changed, and just use C and C++,
like most of our competitors did, you are setting yourself up for
a fall.  A little startup using a more powerful language will eat
your lunch.</p>

<p>Incremental Development</p>

<p>There is a certain style of software development associated with
Lisp.  One of its traditions is incremental development:  you start
by writing, as quickly as possible, a program that does almost
nothing.  Then you gradually add features to it, but at every step
you have working code.</p>

<p>I think this way you get better software, written faster.  Everything
about Lisp is tuned to this style of programming, because Lisp
programmers have worked this way for at least thirty years.</p>

<p>The Viaweb editor must be one of the most extreme cases of incremental
development.  It began with a 120-line program for generating Web
sites that I had used in an example in a book that I finished just
before we started Viaweb.  The Viaweb editor, which eventually grew
to be about 25,000 lines of code, grew incrementally from this
program.  I never once sat down and rewrote the whole thing.  I
don&#8217;t think I was ever more than a day or two without running code.
The whole development process was one long series of gradual changes.</p>

<p>This style of development fits well with the rolling releases that
are possible with Web-based software.  It&#8217;s also a faster way to
get software written generally.</p>

<p>Interactive Toplevel</p>

<p>Lisp&#8217;s interactive toplevel is a great help in developing software
rapidly.  But the biggest advantage for us was probably in finding
bugs.  As I mentioned before, with Web-based applications you have
the users&#8217; data on your servers and can usually reproduce bugs.</p>

<p>When one of the customer support people came to me with a report
of a bug in the editor, I would load the code into the Lisp
interpreter and log into the user&#8217;s account.  If I was able to
reproduce the bug I&#8217;d get an actual break loop, telling me exactly
what was going wrong.  Often I could fix the code and release a
fix right away.  And when I say right away, I mean while the user
was still on the phone.</p>

<p>Such fast turnaround on bug fixes put us into an impossibly tempting
position.  If we could catch and fix a bug while the user was still
on the phone, it was very tempting for us to give the user the
impression that they were imagining it.  And so we sometimes (to
their delight) had the customer support people tell the user to
just try logging in again and see if they still had the problem.
And of course when the user logged back in they&#8217;d get the newly
released version of the software with the bug fixed, and everything
would work fine.  I realize this was a bit sneaky of us, but it
was also a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Macros for Html</p>

<p>Lisp macros were another big win for us.  We used them very
extensively in the Viaweb editor.  It could accurately be described
as one big macro.  And that gives you an idea of how much we depended
on Lisp, because no other language has macros in the sense that
Lisp does.</p>

<p>One way we used macros was to generate Html.  There is a very
natural fit between macros and Html, because Html is a prefix
notation like Lisp, and Html is recursive like Lisp.  So we had
macro calls within macro calls, generating the most complicated
Html, and it was all still very manageable.</p>

<p>Embedded Languages</p>

<p>Another big use for macros was the embedded language we had for
describing pages, called Rtml.  (We made up various explanations
for what Rtml was supposed to stand for, but actually I named it
after Robert Morris, the other founder of Viaweb, whose username
is Rtm.)</p>

<p>Every page made by our software was generated by a program written
in Rtml.  We called these programs templates to make them less
frightening, but they were real programs.  In fact, they were Lisp
programs.  Rtml was a combination of macros and the built-in Lisp
operators.</p>

<p>Users could write their own Rtml templates to describe what they
wanted their pages to look like.  We had a structure editor for
manipulating these templates, a lot like the structure editor they
had in Interlisp.  Instead of typing free-form text, you cut and
pasted bits of code together.  This meant that it was impossible
to get syntax errors.  It also meant that we didn&#8217;t have to display
the parentheses in the underlying s-expressions:  we could show
structure by indentation.  By this means we made the language look
a lot less threatening.</p>

<p>We also designed Rtml so that there could be no errors at runtime:
every Rtml program yielded some kind of Web page, and you could
debug it by hacking it until it produced the page you meant it to.</p>

<p>Initially we expected our users to be Web consultants, and we
expected them to use Rtml a lot.  We provided some default templates
for section pages and item pages and so on, and the idea was that
the users could take them and modify them to make whatever pages
they wanted.</p>

<p>In fact it turned out that Web consultants didn&#8217;t like Viaweb.
Consultants, as a general rule, like to use products that are too
hard for their clients to use, because it guarantees them ongoing
employment.  Consultants would come to our Web site, which said
all over it that our software was so easy to use that it would let
anyone make an online store in five minutes, and they&#8217;d say, there&#8217;s
no way we&#8217;re using that.  So we didn&#8217;t get a lot of interest from
Web consultants.  Instead the users all tended to be end-users,
the actual merchants themselves.  They loved the idea of being in
control of their own Web sites.  And this kind of user did not want
to do any kind of programming.  They just used the default templates.</p>

<p>So Rtml didn&#8217;t end up being the main interface to the program.  It
ended up playing two roles.  First of all, it was an escape valve
for the really sophisticated users, who wanted something our built-in
templates couldn&#8217;t provide.  Somewhere in the course of doing
Viaweb, someone gave me a very useful piece of advice: users always
want an upgrade path, even though as a rule they&#8217;ll never take it.
Rtml was our upgrade path.  If you wanted to, you could get absolute
control over everything on your pages.</p>

<p>Only one out of every couple hundred users actually wrote their
own templates.  And this led to the second advantage of Rtml.  By
looking at the way these users modified our built-in templates, we
knew what we needed to add to them.  Eventually we made it our goal
that no one should ever have to use Rtml.  Our built-in templates
should do everything people wanted.  In this new approach, Rtml
served us as a warning sign that something was missing in our
software.</p>

<p>The third and biggest win from using Rtml was the advantage we
ourselves got from it.  Even if we had been the only people who
used Rtml, it would have been very much worth while writing the
software that way.  Having that extra layer of abstraction in our
software gave us a big advantage over competitors.  It made the
design of our software much cleaner, for one thing.  Instead of
just having bits of actual C or Perl code that generated our Web
pages, like our competitors, we had a very high-level language for
generating Web pages, and our page styles specified in that.  It
made the code much cleaner and easier to modify.  I&#8217;ve already
mentioned that Web-based applications get released as a series of
many small modifications.  When you do that you want to be able to
know how serious any given modification is.  By dividing your code
into layers, you get a better handle on this.  Modifying stuff in
lower layers (Rtml itself) was a serious matter to be done rarely,
and after much thought.  Whereas modifying the top layers (template
code) was something you could do quickly without worrying too much
about the consequences.</p>

<p>Rtml was a very Lispy proposition.  It was mostly Lisp macros, to
start with.  The online editor was, behind the scenes, manipulating
s-expressions.  And when people ran templates, they got compiled
into Lisp functions by calling compile at runtime.</p>

<p>Rtml even depended heavily on keyword parameters, which up to that
time I had always considered one of the more dubious features of
Common Lisp.  Because of the way Web-based software gets released,
you have to design the software so that it&#8217;s easy to change.  And
Rtml itself had to be easy to change, just like any other part of
the software.  Most of the operators in Rtml were designed to take
keyword parameters, and what a help that turned out to be.  If I
wanted to add another dimension to the behavior of one of the
operators, I could just add a new keyword parameter, and everyone&#8217;s
existing templates would continue to work.  A few of the Rtml
operators didn&#8217;t take keyword parameters, because I didn&#8217;t think
I&#8217;d ever need to change them, and almost every one I ended up
kicking myself about later.  If I could go back and start over from
scratch, one of the things I&#8217;d change would be that I&#8217;d make every
Rtml operator take keyword parameters.</p>

<p>We had a couple embedded languages within the editor, in fact.
Another one, which we didn&#8217;t expose directly to the users, was for
describing images.  Viaweb included an image generator, written in
C, that could take a description of an image, create that image,
and return its url.  We used s-expressions to describe these images
as well.</p>

<p>Closures Simulate Subroutines</p>

<p>One of the problems with using Web pages as a UI is the inherent
statelessness of Web sessions.  We got around this by using lexical
closures to simulate subroutine-like behavior.  If you understand
about continuations, one way to explain what we did would be to
say that we wrote our software in continuation-passing style.</p>

<p>When most web-based software generates a link on a page, it tends
to be thinking, if the user clicks on this link, I want to call
this cgi script with these arguments.  When our software generated
a link, it could think, if the user clicks on this link, I want to
run this piece of code.  And the piece of code could an arbitrary
piece of code, possibly (in fact, usually) containing free variables
whose value came from the surrounding context.</p>

<p>The way we did this was to write a macro that took an initial
argument expected to be a closure, followed by a body of code.
The code would then get stored in a global hash table under a unique
id, and whatever output was generated by the code in the body would
appear within a link whose url contained that hash key.  If that
link was the next one clicked on, our software would find and call
the corresponding bit of code, and the chain would continue.
Effectively we were writing cgi scripts on the fly, except that
they were closures that could refer to the surrounding context.</p>

<p>So far this sounds very theoretical, so let me give you an example
of where this technique made an obvious difference.  One of the
things you often want to do in Web-based applications is edit an
object with various types of properties.  Many of the properties
of an object can be represented as form fields or menus.  If you&#8217;re
editing an object representing a person, for example, you might
get a field, for their name, a menu choice for their title, and so
on.</p>

<p>Now what happens when some object has a property that is a color?
If you use ordinary cgi scripts, where everything has to happen on
one form, with an Update button at the bottom, you are going to
have a hard time.  You could use a text field and make the user
type an rgb number into it, but end-users don&#8217;t like that.  Or you
could have a menu of possible colors, but then you have to limit
the possible colors, or otherwise even to offer just the standard
Web colormap, you&#8217;d need 256 menu items with barely distinguishable
names.</p>

<p>What we were able to do, in Viaweb, was display a color as a swatch
representing the current value, followed by a button that said
&#8220;Change.&#8221;  If the user clicked on the Change button they&#8217;d go to
a page with an imagemap of colors to choose among.  And after they
chose a color, they&#8217;d be back on the page where they were editing
the object&#8217;s properties, with that color changed.  This is what I
mean about simulating subroutine-like behavior.  The software could
behave as if it were returning from having chosen a color.  It
wasn&#8217;t, of course; it was making a new cgi call that looked like
going back up a stack.  But by using closures, we could make it
look to the user, and to ourselves, as if we were just doing a
subroutine call.  We could write the code to say, if the user clicks
on this link, go to the color selection page, and then come back
here.  This was just one of the places were we took advantage of
this possibility.  It made our software visibly more sophisticated
than that of our competitors.</p>

<p>Python悖论——计算机也有方言？</p>

<p>在最近一次访谈中，我有个说法让很多人不爽：开发Python项目的程序员比搞Java项目的聪明。</p>

<p>我可不是说Java程序员就笨。我只是说Python程序员聪明。学一门新的编程语言费时费力。学Python的人绝不是为了找工作才学的，而是因为他们打心底里就喜欢编程，又不满意已经会的语言。</p>

<p>这正是那种公司需要的程序员。我找不到贴切地说法，姑且称之为Python悖论：如果一家公司刻意采用深奥的语言编程，就能招到更优秀的程序员，因为只有真心实意学编程语言的人才会来应聘。对于程序员，这个悖论更是显而易见：要想找个好工作，就要学一种不是仅仅为了找工作的语言。</p>

<p>迄今为止，只有少数几家聪明的公司意识到了这一点。但它们现在的确也用这种选拔方式：这些公司恰恰是程序员们趋之若鹜的。例如谷歌。发布Java编程招聘的时候，他们也要求有Python的经验。</p>

<p>我有个朋友，常用的语言几乎没有他不会的，但大部分项目他都用Python。他说，最主要的原因是喜欢其源代码。这种选择语言的理由貌似很无聊。不过还是有点道理的：编程的时候，读代码花的时间比写代码多。你堆砌源代码的方式就像雕塑家堆粘土一样。粘土里疙瘩太多，雕塑家就会抓狂，源代码太烂，严谨的程序员也会发疯。</p>

<p>说到源代码太烂，人们自然就会想到Perl。不过我所指的不是Perl那种肤浅的烂。句法僵化算不上真烂，基于错误概念编程才令人痛不欲生。Perl就像是卡通娃娃口吐秽语，但它也有Python所不及的理念。</p>

<p>点到为止。这两种语言当然都在发展。但它们，以及Ruby (还有Icon、Joy、J、Lisp和Smalltalk)，都有一个共同点，创造它们、使用它们的人都是真正关心编程的人。而这些人往往是编程高手。</p>

<p>================================</p>

<p>August 2004 In a recent talk I said something that upset a lot of people: that you could get smarter programmers to work on a Python project than you could to work on a Java project.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t mean by this that Java programmers are dumb. I meant that Python programmers are smart. It&#8217;s a lot of work to learn a new programming language. And people don&#8217;t learn Python because it will get them a job; they learn it because they genuinely like to program and aren&#8217;t satisfied with the languages they already know.</p>

<p>Which makes them exactly the kind of programmers companies should want to hire. Hence what, for lack of a better name, I&#8217;ll call the Python paradox: if a company chooses to write its software in a comparatively esoteric language, they&#8217;ll be able to hire better programmers, because they&#8217;ll attract only those who cared enough to learn it. And for programmers the paradox is even more pronounced: the language to learn, if you want to get a good job, is a language that people don&#8217;t learn merely to get a job.</p>

<p>Only a few companies have been smart enough to realize this so far. But there is a kind of selection going on here too: they&#8217;re exactly the companies programmers would most like to work for. Google, for example. When they advertise Java programming jobs, they also want Python experience.</p>

<p>A friend of mine who knows nearly all the widely used languages uses Python for most of his projects. He says the main reason is that he likes the way source code looks. That may seem a frivolous reason to choose one language over another. But it is not so frivolous as it sounds: when you program, you spend more time reading code than writing it. You push blobs of source code around the way a sculptor does blobs of clay. So a language that makes source code ugly is maddening to an exacting programmer, as clay full of lumps would be to a sculptor.</p>

<p>At the mention of ugly source code, people will of course think of Perl. But the superficial ugliness of Perl is not the sort I mean. Real ugliness is not harsh-looking syntax, but having to build programs out of the wrong concepts. Perl may look like a cartoon character swearing, but there are cases where it surpasses Python conceptually.</p>

<p>So far, anyway. Both languages are of course moving targets. But they share, along with Ruby (and Icon, and Joy, and J, and Lisp, and Smalltalk) the fact that they&#8217;re created by, and used by, people who really care about programming. And those tend to be the ones who do it well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.paulgrahamcn.com/article/really">创业究竟是神马</a></p>

<p>我并不清楚对创业学校有什么要说的。所以我决定问问我们所资助的这些创业者，还有什么是我没有写过的？</p>

<p>我正处在一个不同寻常的位置，让我恰好可以来验证我所写的关于创业的那些文章。我希望我在其他话题上所写的文章也是正确的，可是我没有办法验证他们。但我写的关于创业的文章则每6个月就能被大约70人所验证。</p>

<p>所以我给每个创业者发了一份电子邮件，问他们在进行一次创业的过程中，什么最令他们感到意外？这么多人问我是不是哪里搞错了，因为如果我把每件事都解释清楚了，应该没有什么能让他们感到意外的。</p>

<p>我很自豪地告诉你们我收到这样一份回复：</p>

<p>最令我吃惊的是几乎所有的事情都能被准确的预计到。</p>

<p>但坏消息是我收到其他100多份回复列出了他们所遇到的惊喜。</p>

<p>这些回复都有非常相同的模式；很明显的，人们总是被相同的事实所惊讶道。以下是它们中最常见的。</p>

<p>1.小心你的合伙人</p>

<p>这一条被最多创业者提到。通常有两种反馈：你需要小心挑选你的合伙人，并且你需要努力维持你们之间的伙伴关系。</p>

<p>当人们选择合伙人时，他们总是希望花更多的时间在人品和性格上，而不是能力。而那些失败的创业案例中尤其能体现出这一点。从中我们能得到的教训就是：永远不要选那些会半途离开的人作为合伙人。</p>

<p>这里有个典型的回复：</p>

<p>只有当你和一个人一起创业后你才能看出一个人真正的面目。为什么说人品是那么重要呢，因为在创业这个环境中比其他任何环境都更能测试人性。一位创业者曾明确的说过，创业者之间的关系比能力更为重要：</p>

<p>我宁可和一个朋友创业，也不要和一个能力很强的陌生人合伙。创业是如此的艰难而又情绪化的一个事情，友谊所带来的感情的纽带和社交的支持足以弥补能力上的差异。</p>

<p>我们很早已经就意识到这一点了。如果你看看那些风投申请书你会发现，其中关于合伙人之间信任以及相互关系的问题要比他们能力的问题多得多。</p>

<p>在那些成功的创业案例中，创业者很少谈如何选择合伙人，而是更多的谈论如何努力维持他们之间的良好关系。</p>

<p>其中有件事让我很意外，那就是创业伙伴之间的关系如何从朋友进而成为夫妻。我和我合伙人的关系在最初的时候仅仅是每时每刻都会看得到的朋友而已，一起担忧公司的财务状况，一起清理垃圾，公司就像我们孩子一样。我曾经这样总结道：“这就像我们虽然已经结婚了但却没有做爱。”</p>

<p>很多人都用结婚这个词，创业者之间的关系要比你通常看到的同事之间的关系更为紧密。部分原因是因为两者之间，所承受的要压力，差得很多，而另一部分原因则是在最初的时候创业者就是公司的全部了。所以它们之间的关系式建立在物质之上而且小心的维系着的。这是一切的基础。</p>

<p>2.创业将会成为你生活的全部</p>

<p>就像创业者之间的感情要比普通同事之间的感情更紧密一样，创业者和公司之间的关系也更为紧密。创业并不像打工或者上学那样，因为一旦你开始了就再也停不下来了。其中经历对大多数人来说太过于陌生以至于直到事情发生了他们才意识到。</p>

<p>我当初并没有意识到我会将工作时间的每一分每一秒都花在创业上。当你的公司在和别人的公司PK时，你就会进入一个完全不同的生活方式。而这一情况也会因为创业阶段快速的生活节奏而愈演愈烈，甚至时间看上去都变慢了。</p>

<p>我认为最令我意外的事情就是一个人通过创业，他对时间的看法会发生很大的变化。就拿我的创业来讲吧，我记得时间看上去就像在慢慢蠕动，一个月对我来说就是很长一段时间了。</p>

<p>在最好的案例中，甚至存在达到忘我境界的人。连你自己也会对你沉浸其中的程度感到吃惊，你会不分日夜的考虑工作的事情，但却一点也不觉得是在工作。</p>

<p>虽然我不得不说明，这引用了我们今年夏天资助的一位创业着的讲话。再过几年也许他就没法那么高兴了。</p>

<p>3.这是一个大悲大喜的事</p>

<p>还有一个事也让很多人感到惊讶，情绪的波动要比他们预想的极端得多。</p>

<p>在创业中，事情一会看上去很完美，而下一刻又让人感觉毫无希望。这里的下一刻我指的是几个小时之后。对我来说情绪的波动是最大的意外。头一天我可能还想象自己的公司是下一个谷歌，做梦想着买小岛；之后又在想怎么和我们所爱的人说出自己即将到来失败。就这样不停的循环。</p>

<p>很明显的，最难熬过去的是那些失落的时候。对很多创业者来说如何在困难的日子里激励每一个人，是最大的挑战。比如，在经过一段时间后，如果你不能取得一些成功来激励你自己，那么失败就会将你淘汰出局。</p>

<p>我对创业者最基本的建议是“不要死”，但维持一个公司在困境中生存下去的能量并不是无穷无境的。这些能量都是从创业者身上压出来的。</p>

<p>你能承受的压力总是有个极限的。如果你达到了你的极限，那么你就不能再做更多的事了。但这并不是世界末日，很多著名的创业者在他们的创业路途上都曾经有过几次失败的经历。</p>

<p>4.创业可能很有意思</p>

<p>好消息是，在你情绪高潮的时候也的确是非常的快乐。几位创业者说最令他们吃惊的是创业居然可以如此有趣：</p>

<p>我想你可能忽略了创业是多么有趣这一事实。我比我任何一个没有创业的朋友都更能从工作中得到满足感。</p>

<p>而这些创业者最喜欢的是工作的自由性：</p>

<p>我最惊讶的是在与之前所做的那种普通雇员时相比，做一份如此有挑战性，创造性以及我所认同的工作，我会感觉如此良好。</p>

<p>坦白来说，如果我在这里误导了人们，那么我宁愿不去修改这个错误。我宁可人人都觉得创业是一项无聊且困难的工作，而不是让他们抱着一种有趣的期望来创业。因为几个月后，他们会说“这应该是有趣的？你在开玩笑么？”</p>

<p>事实是，对大多数人来说创业并不有趣。我们在申请程序中所极力想要做的，就是剔除那些不喜欢创业的人，不管是因为我们的原因还是他自己的原因使得他不喜欢。</p>

<p>最好的方式来看待这个问题可能是这样的：如果你沉浸到创业中，那么开始一次创业是有趣的，一次生存训练课程是有趣的。换句话说，如果你没有沉浸其中，那么它一点都不有趣。</p>

<p>5.坚持是关键</p>

<p>很多创业者对坚持在创业中的重要程度而感到惊讶。这既是一个正面的也是一个负面的意外。</p>

<p>每个人都说你需要下多大的决心，需要多大的弹性。但经历过这一切以后，我意识到，这些所宣称的程度还远远不够。</p>

<p>并且关于坚持能解决什么程度的问题：如果你坚持不懈，那么即使是你无法控制的问题，例如，移民问题，也能够迎刃而解。</p>

<p>几位创业者都提到了，坚持要比聪明重要得多。</p>

<p>而我呢，我一次又一次的意识到坚持比智力要重要得太多太多。 一般来说，在申请中这里指的不仅仅是智力也包括能力，这也是为什么很多人说个性在选择合伙人中最重要。</p>

<p>6.眼光要远</p>

<p>你需要坚持，因为所有的事都会花费比你预想的更多的时间。很多人则对此感到意外</p>

<p>就我自己而言，总是频繁地对每件事能花费那么多时间而感到意外。假设你的产品并没有像极个别产品那样发生爆炸性的增长。所有的事，从开发到销售（尤其是销售）看上去比你预期的要多花2到3倍的时间。</p>

<p>创业者对此感到意外的原因之一是他们自己工作得很快，他们希望其他人也能有这种速度。当一个创业公司接触到一个多分枝的组织，例如一个大公司和一个风投基金的时候，就有很大数量的公司被淘汰出局。这就是为什么很多集资和企业加市场扼杀了那么多创业公司的原因。</p>

<p>但我认为绝大多数创业者感到意外的原因是因为他们过于自信了。他们认为他们会像YouTube 和facebook一样马上就会取得成功。如果你告诉他们只有百分之一的创业企业能有那样的发展轨迹，那么他们会告诉你“我们就要成为那百分之一”</p>

<p>可能他们会愿意听听最成功的创业者之一：在我开始创业之前最让我不明白的事情就是，坚持到底是这场游戏的全部。对大多数成功的创业者来说，这是一个漫长的过程，最少也要3年而一般来说都要5年以上。</p>

<p>当然长期的考虑问题也有它积极的一面。你并不需要不停的修改重新设定你的计划，使每件事都花费更多的时间。如果你耐心地工作，那么你就不会那么有压力，也就能更好的完成工作。</p>

<p>因为在放松的情况下，我们就更容易从工作中获得乐趣。失败就是笨拙紧张能量的聚合，而这些能量则是由不能失败的绝望的需求产生的。我们应该把注意力放在怎样为我们的产品，公司，职员和客户做到最好。</p>

<p>这就是为什么当你达到你的预期收益率时，你会觉得一切都变得更顺利了，你会进入一种完全不同的工作模式。</p>

<p>7.很多琐碎的事情</p>

<p>我们常常强调很少有创业公司仅仅因为他们有一个很好的创意就获得成功的。我认为创业者现在就应该把这个刻进他们的脑子里。很多人创业以后才发现在创业中这条也是适用的。你必须做很多不同的事情：</p>

<p>与其说创业是一个富有吸引力的事不如说是件苦差事。如果你随机的挑个时间来找我，那我很有可能在在处理瑞典语windows中一个奇怪的DLL文件加载问题，或者在董事会的前一夜，处理EXCEL表单中金融模型的一个错误，而不是突然有一个公司策略的好主意。</p>

<p>绝大多数的IT创业者希望把他们所有的时间用在编写程序上。事实上你不可能做到这样，除非你的创业失败了。换句话说：如果你把你所有的时间都用在编程上， 你必定会失败。</p>

<p>当然，这条定律并不仅仅针对编程。很少有仅仅是一个聪明的程序员就能保证创业的成功：</p>

<p>我从我的经历中学到一点，永远不要将创业的成功赌在一个人的特长，一笔交易或者任何类似的东西上。创业从来就不是由一件事决定的。每件事对其都有所助益，而你要做的就是不停的做各种各样的事直到你达到一定程度。</p>

<p>即使在那些极少数案例中，因为一个出色的程序员而获得成功。你也不太可能在事前就知道。事实上根本就没有所谓的决定性的一点。或者至少你事先不会知道是哪一点。</p>

<p>所以最好的策略就是尝试很多不同的事情。不要把鸡蛋放在同一个篮子里，这个道理并不那么简单，即使在你知道哪个篮子是最好的，的情况下它也仍然适用，更何况在创业中你并不知道哪个是最好的。</p>

<p>8.从小事做起</p>

<p>很多创业者都提到要从最容易成功的事做起。到了这个时候，每个人都知道应该不断地快速发布产品。在我们风投行业更是如此。但依然有很多人因为没有这么做而被淘汰。完成一件最小的事也可以被认为是一次完整的应用然后把它装箱送出去。</p>

<p>为什么人们总是在第一版的时候花费那么多时间呢？主要是因为自豪，他们不愿意在还能有所改进的时候就把产品发布到市场上。他们担心人们可能会指责这些缺陷。但你必须克服这样的心理。在一开始做一些简单的事情，并不意味着你没有做有意义的，可辩解的或者有价值的事情。不要担心人么会讲什么。如果你的第一版做得很完美，那么改进它就会变得毫无乐趣。你会等得太久而无法发布你的产品。</p>

<p>一位创业者说对任何项目来说都应该遵循这一原则，并不仅仅是创业的时候。对此我也深有同感。</p>

<p>现在，当我在编程的时候，我努力想：“我怎么能写这样的程序呢，如果人们看到的话，会为其只有那么小而感到惊讶。”</p>

<p>过度设计对产品来说就是一剂毒药。这不像你为额外的信用而做额外的工作。这更像是你说了个慌，然后你不得不记住它，防止你自相矛盾。</p>

<p>9.使用户参与其中</p>

<p>产品开发就是一场与用户的对话，而通常这一过程并不会发生，直到你发布产品。在发布产品之前，你就像一个在把他第一稿的素描给目击人看之前的警察局的拼图师。</p>

<p>快速的发布产品是如此的重要以至于你可以考虑不要将你的第一版作为一个产品，而是作为一个引起用户谈论，关注的策略。</p>

<p>我从中学到，要把创业的初始阶段看做是一场巨大的实验。所有的产品都应该被纳入试验中。那些有市场的产品很快就会达到预期的结果。一旦你开始你与用户的对话，你会为他们和你说的感到意外。</p>

<p>当你让顾客告诉你他们在追逐什么的时候，他们通常会揭示出一些惊人的细节，这些是他们觉得有意义的，同时也是他们愿意付钱的部分。</p>

<p>当然这些意外既有正面的也有负面的。他们可能和你所预想的完全不同，但有些也可能很容易就能加入你原有的设计。只有当你通过发布一个错误的东西开始和客户的对话，他们才能表达出（或者意识到）什么是他们所盼望的。</p>

<p>10.改变你的想法</p>

<p>为了能从顾客参与的产品开发中获益，你必须愿意修改你的想法。我们常常鼓励创业者把创业的主意当做是一个假设而不是一个蓝图。但人们依然对做出改变后带来的好处感到惊讶。通常来说当你抱怨一件事很困难的时候，一般的建议就是更努力地工作。而在一个创业中，我认为你应该找出一个容易解决的问题。在答案中不断寻找完美的解决方案是我们所熟悉的。但如果你在问题的范围里多做点思考的话你会有巨大的收获。</p>

<p>但如果只有决心没有灵活变通的能力的话，创业只对你只能是一个贪婪的过程，然后得到一个不好不坏的结果。</p>

<p>当一个人下定决心以后，他仍然有走上一条又长又困难的不归路的风险。你想要有所进展，但在同时却不停的徘徊、游荡寻找一条最有希望的路。有一位创业者用非常简洁的语言归纳了这点：</p>

<p>现在我再也不会嘲笑别人的想法了，因为我意识到我分别一个主意是好是坏的能力太差了。</p>

<p>你永远不知道什么是行得通的。你只要在每一点上尽量做得最好就可以了。在YC中我们也执行这一条。我们依然不知道一个想法是否可行，但它看上去就像一连串的假设。</p>

<p>11.不要担心有竞争者</p>

<p>当你觉得你有一个很棒的想法时，这就像是对什么事有所愧疚一样。人们所做的就是看你的笑话，然后你就会想：“啊，他们知道”</p>

<p>这些警告几乎总是错的：那些你第一眼看上去像是你竞争对手的公司通常在你仔细研究后会发现他们并不是。即使他们和你的公司在相同领域里，但你们有着不同的目标。</p>

<p>人们对竞争反应过度的原因之一就是人们对创意的价值过分高估了。如果创意真的是成功的关键，那么有着相同创意的竞争者就会是一个真正的威胁。不过通常是执行力影响了最后的结果。：</p>

<p>所有的恐惧，包括对一个新竞争对手的出现的都会在几周后被遗忘。最终你还是要回到你的产品上，然后将它发布到市场中。通常情况下这一条都是适用的，即使竞争对手获得了很多的关注。</p>

<p>那些在博客排行榜上停留在前列的竞争者很少会成为最终的赢家，而且可能很快就从人么的视线中消失了。你所需要的最终也只是消费者而已，大肆宣传并不会带来满意的用户，至少对这么复杂的技术类产品商品不会。</p>

<p>12.争取用户很困难</p>

<p>很多创业者抱怨为了争取客户有多么困难。我也不知道吸引用户需要花费多少精力和时间。这是一个复杂的问题。当你没有用户的时候，很难说是否是缺乏宣传，或者仅仅是产品不够好。即使是好产品也可能因为置换成本和整合成本而不受欢迎。</p>

<p>让人们开始使用一种全新的服务更是困难重重。这一点对那种其他公司也能提供的服务尤其困难，因为这要求它的开发商做更多的工作。如果你是很小的公司，那么他们不会觉得这是很紧急的事情。我们在YC面临的最尖锐的危机，正如我们的一位创业者所说的那样，不够专注于客户的获取。YC鼓励的是“做客户想要的东西”的理念，不断的改进一个又一个产品特性，直到有足够人感到满意或者产品下架为止。我们很少关注在客户获取方面的花费。</p>

<p>这可能很严重；这可能是我们需要改进的地方，尤其对于游戏这一类的软件来说。如果你只是在技术上做一些有挑战的东西。那么你可以靠口口相传来争取你的用户，就像谷歌那样。一位创业者对这样做所取得的良好效果而感到意外：</p>

<p>在创业的过程中你可能会产生一种非理性的恐惧，担心人们不会买你的产品。但如果你努力工作并不断完善你的产品，那么这完全是一种多余的担忧。</p>

<p>但对其他类型的创业来说，关注交易和市场营销要比关注于产品更能给你带来成功。</p>

<p>13.在交易中做最坏的打算</p>

<p>生意失败。这是创业中的常事。创业总是很无力的，而好的创意看上去总是错的。所以每个人总是迫不及待地想要结束和你的交易，而你没办法改变他们。</p>

<p>对投资者来说尤其是这样：</p>

<p>回头来看，如果我们当初能以没有任何外部投资的假设去进行我们的创业的话，我们将会取得更大的成功。这样做会使我们更加专注于寻找利润来源。</p>

<p>关于这一点我的建议是尽量保持悲观。假设你自己不会得到任何投资，即使你得到了一些投资，假设你不会再有更多的投资。</p>

<p>如果一个人向你投资，那么接受它。你会谈论很多，但我觉得 你需要更重视它。去年我们曾有机会募集到比我们实际募集到的金额多得多钱。我真希望我们当时能抓住机会。</p>

<p>为什么创业者往往会忽视这一点？主要是因为他们天生就是乐观主义者。而错就错在你不该对不在你掌控中的事乐观。你可以对的产品和你的能力尽一切可能的保持乐观，但如果你对大公司或者投资人保持乐观的话，那么你只是自讨苦吃而已。</p>

<p>14.投资人都是无知的</p>

<p>很多创业者都提到当他们意识到投资者是无知的时候有多惊讶。</p>

<p>他们甚至都不了解他们所投资的东西到底是什么东西。我遇到过一些投资同一家硬件厂商的投资者，当我要求他们演示一下他们的产品时，他们居然连开关都有困难。</p>

<p>天使投资在这方面要比风险投资要好一点，至少他们还是有创业的经历的。</p>

<p>风投对他们所谈论的东西有一半以上是不懂的。而且他们的思想也远远落后于时代。只有一些是很好的，而我们所接触到的剩下的95%都是不专业的，看上去就不像是个做生意的料以及任何创造性的眼光。天使投资在这方面更值得交流。</p>

<p>为什么创业者对投资人的无知会感到意外呢？我认为是因为在创业者眼中，投资人的形象是如此高大。</p>

<p>而投资人看上去高大又是因为他们的专长就是如此。他们必须让资产经理信任他们，把几亿美元都委托给他们。如果是你你要怎么做？你必须显得很有自信，显得你很懂技术的样子。</p>

<p>15.你可能不得不耍些小手段</p>

<p>因为投资人在看人的时候太不准了。所以你不得不更加努力的推销你自己。一个创业者所说的最令他意外的经历是：你装的越自信，投资人就印象越好</p>

<p>在YC创业者经历中这是最令我意外的了。这个夏天我们邀请了一些校友来和新学员一起讨论资金募集。几乎100%他们给的意见都是关于投资者心理学的。我以前一直认为我对投资者已经都敷衍了。但这些创业者则更加敷衍，很多创业者所做的仅仅只是装装样子而已，但它的确管用。</p>

<p>风投自己并不知道他们所看中的那些创业者有多善于推销自己。而这又恰恰是我们在早先的阶段中所观察到的现象。风投通过在LP前装逼来拿到钱，创业者则在风投面前装逼来拿到钱。</p>

<p>16.运气是个很重要的因素</p>

<p>既然在创业者和钱之间的联系是如此的随机，那也就不应该奇怪运气在生意中式一个很重要的因素。但仍然有很多创业者对此感到意外。</p>

<p>我当时并没有意识到运气扮演了多重要的一个角色，以及它是多么的不可控。</p>

<p>如果你想想那些著名的创业公司，很明显运气都扮演了一个重要的角色。如果IBM坚持保有DOS系统的专利权，那么微软现在会在哪里呢？</p>

<p>为什么创业者会被这点所蒙蔽呢？生意人可能不会，但黑客们早就习惯了一个技术至上的世界，你得到你所应得的。当我们开始我们的创业的时候，我承载了我们夸张的梦想：这只是一场技术的竞争而已。从某种角度来说的确是这样。技术是有价值的，所以它们也是这样被定义的。但运气好才是决定性的因素。</p>

<p>准确来首，最好的模型会把一次创业的结局定义为技术，决心和运气的产物。无论你有多好的技巧，多大的决心，如果你的运气很差，那么结局也必然是失败的。</p>

<p>这些话并不是那些失败的创业者说的。那些很快就失败的创业者都倾向于责怪他们自己。而那些很快就获得成功的人也不会意识到它们自己是多幸运。处在两者之间的人则刚刚好能看清运气的重要性。</p>

<p>17.社区的价值</p>

<p>有惊人数量的创业者提高了社区的价值。一些指的是YC学员这个小圈子：</p>

<p>YC同辈学员之间的巨大价值，它们会在差不多相同的时间遇到相同的困难。但这并不应该让人感到意外，因为它就是这样被构建的。而其他人则在更大的范围内上感受创业社区的价值。住在硅谷有多大优势？在那里你会不断听到所有尖端的科学技术和创业消息，以及马上和有用的人面对面交流。而最令他们意外的是创业者之间普遍的慈善精神。</p>

<p>我所看到最令我意外的就是人们都愿意帮助我们。即使他们不能从中得到些什么，他们还是会抽出时间帮我们获得成功。</p>

<p>尤其是这一点如何无时无刻的伸展在你生活的每一处：</p>

<p>最令我意外就是接触重要和有趣的人有多容易。你很容易就能和他们碰到然后马上得到反馈。这也是我选择成为他们中一员的原因。创造财富并不是一场零和博弈，所以你不需要把人家拉下来，以确保自己的胜利。</p>

<p>18.你得不到尊重</p>

<p>有一个创业者提出的意外是我宁可忘记的：在创业者的世界之外，创业者不会得到任何尊敬。</p>

<p>在我们的社会设定中，我发现如果我说我在微软工作，会比说我在一家叫X的新创业的企业工作获得更多的尊敬。</p>

<p>一部分是因为剩下的人并不创业，而另一部分原因是因为绝大多数的好的创业的想法看上去就很坏。</p>

<p>如果你随机的向一个路人宣传你的想法，95%的人凭直觉会认为你的创意会失败，而你只是在浪费时间而已（虽然他们并不一定会那么直接的说出来）。</p>

<p>不幸的是，这甚至蔓延到约会上了：</p>

<p>让我感到意外的是，作为一个创业者并不能从女人那里获得更多的青睐。</p>

<p>我的确知道这一点，但我宁可忘记它。</p>

<p>19.你的事业和你一起在成长</p>

<p>创业者们提到的最后一个意外就是，事情会随着你的成长而发生翻天覆地的变化。最大的改变就是你会做更少的编程工作。</p>

<p>你作为一个技术型创业者或者CEO的角色，每6到12个月就会被重新定义一次。你将花更少的时间在编程上，花更多的时间在管理，计划，公司建设，人事，处理杂事以及在事情发生几个月前就安排好相关的事务。</p>

<p>尤其是你现在需要开始和不同的员工打交道，而他们往往各自抱着不同的动机。</p>

<p>我知道作为一个创业者需要关注什么方面，并且从我19岁想要创业的时候就已经开始关注了。但和一个雇员需要关注的东西是非常不同的，而这花了我一些时间来适应。幸运的是，在熟悉这些以后，你就不会觉得压力那么大了：</p>

<p>和最初开始创业的时候相比，现在我们所承受的压力只有当初的25%。现在经营一个公司变得越来越有趣。我们熬夜奋战的次数少了，我们睡眠的时间多了。</p>

<p>我希望我能够说所有成功的创业都是这样的，但75%的都是始终处在很大的压力之下的。</p>

<p>超级模式</p>

<p>当然还存在着许多其他的模式，但是这些是最重要的。任何一个人第一眼看到这些的时候都是问这是不是一个超级模式，模式中的模式。</p>

<p>我马上就意识到了这一点，同时我读给一位YC的创立者听，他也马上意识到了。如果这些都是我没有告诉过人们的话，这些的确可以是一种意外。但他们之间都有一些共通点，他们都是我曾经说过的。如果我用相同的大纲写一篇新的文章，那不会是一篇对创业者反馈的总结，每个人都会说我已经才思枯竭，并且在重复自己的东西而已。</p>

<p>然后呢？</p>

<p>当我看到这些回复的时候，通常的主题都是说创业绝大部分都像我所说的那样，但远不仅仅是那样。所以人们知道自己亲身去做才知道创业有多困难。为什么会这样呢？问题的关键就在于要问，和什么相比创业是困难的。一旦你开始这样想以后，答案就很明显了：和打工相比。每个人对工作的概念一开始都是打工。这一条是非常普遍的。即使你从来没有打过工，你的爸妈可能打过，即使他们也没有，你成长道路上遇到的每个成年人都可能打过。</p>

<p>无形中，人们就对创业抱有一种打工的期望，这就解释了绝大部分的意外。这一条解释了为什么人们对要多么仔细挑选合伙人，多努力去维持你们的关系而感到意外了。在同事之间你就不需要这样做。它也解释了为什么人们对情绪的波动感到极端的意外。在打工过程中，生活总是显得很沉闷。这也解释了为什么好的时候感觉会那么棒：大多数的人都无法想象这种自由。当你浏览这份列表的时候，几乎所有的意外都是对于创业和打工之间的区别的。</p>

<p>你似乎不能轻易的改变一些如此普遍而又随着你的成长不断加深的关于工作的期望。所以最好的解决办法就是不断有意识的提醒自己。当你走进创业的世界的时，你会觉得每个人讲的都很极端。然后你的下一个想法就是“但我不相信事情会那么差。”如果你想要避免被惊讶到，那么你下一个想法就应该是：“我不能相信事情会变得那么差是因为我对工作的期望是打工。”</p>

<p>===============================</p>

<p>What Startups Are Really Like</p>

<p>October 2009</p>

<p>(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2009 Startup School.)</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure what to talk about at Startup School, so I decided to ask the founders of the startups we&#8217;d funded. What hadn&#8217;t I written about yet?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in the unusual position of being able to test the essays I write about startups. I hope the ones on other topics are right, but I have no way to test them. The ones on startups get tested by about 70 people every 6 months.</p>

<p>So I sent all the founders an email asking what surprised them about starting a startup. This amounts to asking what I got wrong, because if I&#8217;d explained things well enough, nothing should have surprised them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m proud to report I got one response saying:</p>

<p>What surprised me the most is that everything was actually fairly predictable!</p>

<p>The bad news is that I got over 100 other responses listing the surprises they encountered.</p>

<p>There were very clear patterns in the responses; it was remarkable how often several people had been surprised by exactly the same thing. These were the biggest:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be Careful with Cofounders</li>
</ol>


<p>This was the surprise mentioned by the most founders. There were two types of responses: that you have to be careful who you pick as a cofounder, and that you have to work hard to maintain your relationship.</p>

<p>What people wished they&#8217;d paid more attention to when choosing cofounders was character and commitment, not ability. This was particularly true with startups that failed. The lesson: don&#8217;t pick cofounders who will flake.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a typical reponse:</p>

<p>You haven&#8217;t seen someone&#8217;s true colors unless you&#8217;ve worked with them on a startup.</p>

<p>The reason character is so important is that it&#8217;s tested more severely than in most other situations. One founder said explicitly that the relationship between founders was more important than ability:</p>

<p>I would rather cofound a startup with a friend than a stranger with higher output. Startups are so hard and emotional that the bonds and emotional and social support that come with friendship outweigh the extra output lost.</p>

<p>We learned this lesson a long time ago. If you look at the YC application, there are more questions about the commitment and relationship of the founders than their ability.</p>

<p>Founders of successful startups talked less about choosing cofounders and more about how hard they worked to maintain their relationship.</p>

<p>One thing that surprised me is how the relationship of startup founders goes from a friendship to a marriage. My relationship with my cofounder went from just being friends to seeing each other all the time, fretting over the finances and cleaning up shit. And the startup was our baby. I summed it up once like this: &#8220;It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re married, but we&#8217;re not fucking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several people used that word &#8220;married.&#8221; It&#8217;s a far more intense relationship than you usually see between coworkers—partly because the stresses are so much greater, and partly because at first the founders are the whole company. So this relationship has to be built of top quality materials and carefully maintained. It&#8217;s the basis of everything.</p>

<ol>
<li>Startups Take Over Your Life</li>
</ol>


<p>Just as the relationship between cofounders is more intense than it usually is between coworkers, so is the relationship between the founders and the company. Running a startup is not like having a job or being a student, because it never stops. This is so foreign to most people&#8217;s experience that they don&#8217;t get it till it happens. [1]</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t realize I would spend almost every waking moment either working or thinking about our startup. You enter a whole different way of life when it&#8217;s your company vs. working for someone else&#8217;s company.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s exacerbated by the fast pace of startups, which makes it seem like time slows down:</p>

<p>I think the thing that&#8217;s been most surprising to me is how one&#8217;s perspective on time shifts. Working on our startup, I remember time seeming to stretch out, so that a month was a huge interval.</p>

<p>In the best case, total immersion can be exciting:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s surprising how much you become consumed by your startup, in that you think about it day and night, but never once does it feel like &#8220;work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though I have to say, that quote is from someone we funded this summer. In a couple years he may not sound so chipper.</p>

<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s an Emotional Roller-coaster</li>
</ol>


<p>This was another one lots of people were surprised about. The ups and downs were more extreme than they were prepared for.</p>

<p>In a startup, things seem great one moment and hopeless the next. And by next, I mean a couple hours later.</p>

<p>The emotional ups and downs were the biggest surprise for me. One day, we&#8217;d think of ourselves as the next Google and dream of buying islands; the next, we&#8217;d be pondering how to let our loved ones know of our utter failure; and on and on.</p>

<p>The hard part, obviously, is the lows. For a lot of founders that was the big surprise:</p>

<p>How hard it is to keep everyone motivated during rough days or weeks, i.e. how low the lows can be.</p>

<p>After a while, if you don&#8217;t have significant success to cheer you up, it wears you out:</p>

<p>Your most basic advice to founders is &#8220;just don&#8217;t die,&#8221; but the energy to keep a company going in lieu of unburdening success isn&#8217;t free; it is siphoned from the founders themselves.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a limit to how much you can take. If you get to the point where you can&#8217;t keep working anymore, it&#8217;s not the end of the world. Plenty of famous founders have had some failures along the way.</p>

<ol>
<li>It Can Be Fun</li>
</ol>


<p>The good news is, the highs are also very high. Several founders said what surprised them most about doing a startup was how fun it was:</p>

<p>I think you&#8217;ve left out just how fun it is to do a startup. I am more fulfilled in my work than pretty much any of my friends who did not start companies.</p>

<p>What they like most is the freedom:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m surprised by how much better it feels to be working on something that is challenging and creative, something I believe in, as opposed to the hired-gun stuff I was doing before. I knew it would feel better; what&#8217;s surprising is how much better.</p>

<p>Frankly, though, if I&#8217;ve misled people here, I&#8217;m not eager to fix that. I&#8217;d rather have everyone think starting a startup is grim and hard than have founders go into it expecting it to be fun, and a few months later saying &#8220;This is supposed to be fun? Are you kidding?&#8221;</p>

<p>The truth is, it wouldn&#8217;t be fun for most people. A lot of what we try to do in the application process is to weed out the people who wouldn&#8217;t like it, both for our sake and theirs.</p>

<p>The best way to put it might be that starting a startup is fun the way a survivalist training course would be fun, if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing. Which is to say, not at all, if you&#8217;re not.</p>

<ol>
<li>Persistence Is the Key</li>
</ol>


<p>A lot of founders were surprised how important persistence was in startups. It was both a negative and a positive surprise: they were surprised both by the degree of persistence required</p>

<p>Everyone said how determined and resilient you must be, but going through it made me realize that the determination required was still understated.</p>

<p>and also by the degree to which persistence alone was able to dissolve obstacles:</p>

<p>If you are persistent, even problems that seem out of your control (i.e. immigration) seem to work themselves out.</p>

<p>Several founders mentioned specifically how much more important persistence was than intelligence.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been surprised again and again by just how much more important persistence is than raw intelligence.</p>

<p>This applies not just to intelligence but to ability in general, and that&#8217;s why so many people said character was more important in choosing cofounders.</p>

<ol>
<li>Think Long-Term</li>
</ol>


<p>You need persistence because everything takes longer than you expect. A lot of people were surprised by that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m continually surprised by how long everything can take. Assuming your product doesn&#8217;t experience the explosive growth that very few products do, everything from development to dealmaking (especially dealmaking) seems to take 2-3x longer than I always imagine.</p>

<p>One reason founders are surprised is that because they work fast, they expect everyone else to. There&#8217;s a shocking amount of shear stress at every point where a startup touches a more bureaucratic organization, like a big company or a VC fund. That&#8217;s why fundraising and the enterprise market kill and maim so many startups. [2]</p>

<p>But I think the reason most founders are surprised by how long it takes is that they&#8217;re overconfident. They think they&#8217;re going to be an instant success, like YouTube or Facebook. You tell them only 1 out of 100 successful startups has a trajectory like that, and they all think &#8220;we&#8217;re going to be that 1.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maybe they&#8217;ll listen to one of the more successful founders:</p>

<p>The top thing I didn&#8217;t understand before going into it is that persistence is the name of the game. For the vast majority of startups that become successful, it&#8217;s going to be a really long journey, at least 3 years and probably 5+.</p>

<p>There is a positive side to thinking longer-term. It&#8217;s not just that you have to resign yourself to everything taking longer than it should. If you work patiently it&#8217;s less stressful, and you can do better work:</p>

<p>Because we&#8217;re relaxed, it&#8217;s so much easier to have fun doing what we do. Gone is the awkward nervous energy fueled by the desperate need to not fail guiding our actions. We can concentrate on doing what&#8217;s best for our company, product, employees and customers.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why things get so much better when you hit ramen profitability. You can shift into a different mode of working.</p>

<ol>
<li>Lots of Little Things</li>
</ol>


<p>We often emphasize how rarely startups win simply because they hit on some magic idea. I think founders have now gotten that into their heads. But a lot were surprised to find this also applies within startups. You have to do lots of different things:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s much more of a grind than glamorous. A timeslice selected at random would more likely find me tracking down a weird DLL loading bug on Swedish Windows, or tracking down a bug in the financial model Excel spreadsheet the night before a board meeting, rather than having brilliant flashes of strategic insight.</p>

<p>Most hacker-founders would like to spend all their time programming. You won&#8217;t get to, unless you fail. Which can be transformed into: If you spend all your time programming, you will fail.</p>

<p>The principle extends even into programming. There is rarely a single brilliant hack that ensures success:</p>

<p>I learnt never to bet on any one feature or deal or anything to bring you success. It is never a single thing. Everything is just incremental and you just have to keep doing lots of those things until you strike something.</p>

<p>Even in the rare cases where a clever hack makes your fortune, you probably won&#8217;t know till later:</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a killer feature. Or at least you won&#8217;t know what it is.</p>

<p>So the best strategy is to try lots of different things. The reason not to put all your eggs in one basket is not the usual one, which applies even when you know which basket is best. In a startup you don&#8217;t even know that.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with Something Minimal</li>
</ol>


<p>Lots of founders mentioned how important it was to launch with the simplest possible thing. By this point everyone knows you should release fast and iterate. It&#8217;s practically a mantra at YC. But even so a lot of people seem to have been burned by not doing it:</p>

<p>Build the absolute smallest thing that can be considered a complete application and ship it.</p>

<p>Why do people take too long on the first version? Pride, mostly. They hate to release something that could be better. They worry what people will say about them. But you have to overcome this:</p>

<p>Doing something &#8220;simple&#8221; at first glance does not mean you aren&#8217;t doing something meaningful, defensible, or valuable.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry what people will say. If your first version is so impressive that trolls don&#8217;t make fun of it, you waited too long to launch. [3]</p>

<p>One founder said this should be your approach to all programming, not just startups, and I tend to agree.</p>

<p>Now, when coding, I try to think &#8220;How can I write this such that if people saw my code, they&#8217;d be amazed at how little there is and how little it does?&#8221;</p>

<p>Over-engineering is poison. It&#8217;s not like doing extra work for extra credit. It&#8217;s more like telling a lie that you then have to remember so you don&#8217;t contradict it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Engage Users</li>
</ol>


<p>Product development is a conversation with the user that doesn&#8217;t really start till you launch. Before you launch, you&#8217;re like a police artist before he&#8217;s shown the first version of his sketch to the witness.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s so important to launch fast that it may be better to think of your initial version not as a product, but as a trick for getting users to start talking to you.</p>

<p>I learned to think about the initial stages of a startup as a giant experiment. All products should be considered experiments, and those that have a market show promising results extremely quickly.</p>

<p>Once you start talking to users, I guarantee you&#8217;ll be surprised by what they tell you.</p>

<p>When you let customers tell you what they&#8217;re after, they will often reveal amazing details about what they find valuable as well what they&#8217;re willing to pay for.</p>

<p>The surprise is generally positive as well as negative. They won&#8217;t like what you&#8217;ve built, but there will be other things they would like that would be trivially easy to implement. It&#8217;s not till you start the conversation by launching the wrong thing that they can express (or perhaps even realize) what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>

<ol>
<li>Change Your Idea</li>
</ol>


<p>To benefit from engaging with users you have to be willing to change your idea. We&#8217;ve always encouraged founders to see a startup idea as a hypothesis rather than a blueprint. And yet they&#8217;re still surprised how well it works to change the idea.</p>

<p>Normally if you complain about something being hard, the general advice is to work harder. With a startup, I think you should find a problem that&#8217;s easy for you to solve. Optimizing in solution-space is familiar and straightforward, but you can make enormous gains playing around in problem-space.</p>

<p>Whereas mere determination, without flexibility, is a greedy algorithm that may get you nothing more than a mediocre local maximum:</p>

<p>When someone is determined, there&#8217;s still a danger that they&#8217;ll follow a long, hard path that ultimately leads nowhere.</p>

<p>You want to push forward, but at the same time twist and turn to find the most promising path. One founder put it very succinctly:</p>

<p>Fast iteration is the key to success.</p>

<p>One reason this advice is so hard to follow is that people don&#8217;t realize how hard it is to judge startup ideas, particularly their own. Experienced founders learn to keep an open mind:</p>

<p>Now I don&#8217;t laugh at ideas anymore, because I realized how terrible I was at knowing if they were good or not.</p>

<p>You can never tell what will work. You just have to do whatever seems best at each point. We do this with YC itself. We still don&#8217;t know if it will work, but it seems like a decent hypothesis.</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t Worry about Competitors</li>
</ol>


<p>When you think you&#8217;ve got a great idea, it&#8217;s sort of like having a guilty conscience about something. All someone has to do is look at you funny, and you think &#8220;Oh my God, they know.&#8221;</p>

<p>These alarms are almost always false:</p>

<p>Companies that seemed like competitors and threats at first glance usually never were when you really looked at it. Even if they were operating in the same area, they had a different goal.</p>

<p>One reason people overreact to competitors is that they overvalue ideas. If ideas really were the key, a competitor with the same idea would be a real threat. But it&#8217;s usually execution that matters:</p>

<p>All the scares induced by seeing a new competitor pop up are forgotten weeks later. It always comes down to your own product and approach to the market.</p>

<p>This is generally true even if competitors get lots of attention.</p>

<p>Competitors riding on lots of good blogger perception aren&#8217;t really the winners and can disappear from the map quickly. You need consumers after all.</p>

<p>Hype doesn&#8217;t make satisfied users, at least not for something as complicated as technology.</p>

<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s Hard to Get Users</li>
</ol>


<p>A lot of founders complained about how hard it was to get users, though.</p>

<p>I had no idea how much time and effort needed to go into attaining users.</p>

<p>This is a complicated topic. When you can&#8217;t get users, it&#8217;s hard to say whether the problem is lack of exposure, or whether the product&#8217;s simply bad. Even good products can be blocked by switching or integration costs:</p>

<p>Getting people to use a new service is incredibly difficult. This is especially true for a service that other companies can use, because it requires their developers to do work. If you&#8217;re small, they don&#8217;t think it is urgent. [4]</p>

<p>The sharpest criticism of YC came from a founder who said we didn&#8217;t focus enough on customer acquisition:</p>

<p>YC preaches &#8220;make something people want&#8221; as an engineering task, a never ending stream of feature after feature until enough people are happy and the application takes off. There&#8217;s very little focus on the cost of customer acquisition.</p>

<p>This may be true; this may be something we need to fix, especially for applications like games. If you make something where the challenges are mostly technical, you can rely on word of mouth, like Google did. One founder was surprised by how well that worked for him:</p>

<p>There is an irrational fear that no one will buy your product. But if you work hard and incrementally make it better, there is no need to worry.</p>

<p>But with other types of startups you may win less by features and more by deals and marketing.</p>

<ol>
<li>Expect the Worst with Deals</li>
</ol>


<p>Deals fall through. That&#8217;s a constant of the startup world. Startups are powerless, and good startup ideas generally seem wrong. So everyone is nervous about closing deals with you, and you have no way to make them.</p>

<p>This is particularly true with investors:</p>

<p>In retrospect, it would have been much better if we had operated under the assumption that we would never get any additional outside investment. That would have focused us on finding revenue streams early.</p>

<p>My advice is generally pessimistic. Assume you won&#8217;t get money, and if someone does offer you any, assume you&#8217;ll never get any more.</p>

<p>If someone offers you money, take it. You say it a lot, but I think it needs even more emphasizing. We had the opportunity to raise a lot more money than we did last year and I wish we had.</p>

<p>Why do founders ignore me? Mostly because they&#8217;re optimistic by nature. The mistake is to be optimistic about things you can&#8217;t control. By all means be optimistic about your ability to make something great. But you&#8217;re asking for trouble if you&#8217;re optimistic about big companies or investors.</p>

<ol>
<li>Investors Are Clueless</li>
</ol>


<p>A lot of founders mentioned how surprised they were by the cluelessness of investors:</p>

<p>They don&#8217;t even know about the stuff they&#8217;ve invested in. I met some investors that had invested in a hardware device and when I asked them to demo the device they had difficulty switching it on.</p>

<p>Angels are a bit better than VCs, because they usually have startup experience themselves:</p>

<p>VC investors don&#8217;t know half the time what they are talking about and are years behind in their thinking. A few were great, but 95% of the investors we dealt with were unprofessional, didn&#8217;t seem to be very good at business or have any kind of creative vision. Angels were generally much better to talk to.</p>

<p>Why are founders surprised that VCs are clueless? I think it&#8217;s because they seem so formidable.</p>

<p>The reason VCs seem formidable is that it&#8217;s their profession to. You get to be a VC by convincing asset managers to trust you with hundreds of millions of dollars. How do you do that? You have to seem confident, and you have to seem like you understand technology. [5]</p>

<ol>
<li>You May Have to Play Games</li>
</ol>


<p>Because investors are so bad at judging you, you have to work harder than you should at selling yourself. One founder said the thing that surprised him most was</p>

<p>The degree to which feigning certitude impressed investors.</p>

<p>This is the thing that has surprised me most about YC founders&#8217; experiences. This summer we invited some of the alumni to talk to the new startups about fundraising, and pretty much 100% of their advice was about investor psychology. I thought I was cynical about VCs, but the founders were much more cynical.</p>

<p>A lot of what startup founders do is just posturing. It works.</p>

<p>VCs themselves have no idea of the extent to which the startups they like are the ones that are best at selling themselves to VCs. [6] It&#8217;s exactly the same phenomenon we saw a step earlier. VCs get money by seeming confident to LPs, and founders get money by seeming confident to VCs.</p>

<ol>
<li>Luck Is a Big Factor</li>
</ol>


<p>With two such random linkages in the path between startups and money, it shouldn&#8217;t be surprising that luck is a big factor in deals. And yet a lot of founders are surprised by it.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t realize how much of a role luck plays and how much is outside of our control.</p>

<p>If you think about famous startups, it&#8217;s pretty clear how big a role luck plays. Where would Microsoft be if IBM insisted on an exclusive license for DOS?</p>

<p>Why are founders fooled by this? Business guys probably aren&#8217;t, but hackers are used to a world where skill is paramount, and you get what you deserve.</p>

<p>When we started our startup, I had bought the hype of the startup founder dream: that this is a game of skill. It is, in some ways. Having skill is valuable. So is being determined as all hell. But being lucky is the critical ingredient.</p>

<p>Actually the best model would be to say that the outcome is the product of skill, determination, and luck. No matter how much skill and determination you have, if you roll a zero for luck, the outcome is zero.</p>

<p>These quotes about luck are not from founders whose startups failed. Founders who fail quickly tend to blame themselves. Founders who succeed quickly don&#8217;t usually realize how lucky they were. It&#8217;s the ones in the middle who see how important luck is.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Value of Community</li>
</ol>


<p>A surprising number of founders said what surprised them most about starting a startup was the value of community. Some meant the micro-community of YC founders:</p>

<p>The immense value of the peer group of YC companies, and facing similar obstacles at similar times.</p>

<p>which shouldn&#8217;t be that surprising, because that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s structured that way. Others were surprised at the value of the startup community in the larger sense:</p>

<p>How advantageous it is to live in Silicon Valley, where you can&#8217;t help but hear all the cutting-edge tech and startup news, and run into useful people constantly.</p>

<p>The specific thing that surprised them most was the general spirit of benevolence:</p>

<p>One of the most surprising things I saw was the willingness of people to help us. Even people who had nothing to gain went out of their way to help our startup succeed.</p>

<p>and particularly how it extended all the way to the top:</p>

<p>The surprise for me was how accessible important and interesting people are. It&#8217;s amazing how easily you can reach out to people and get immediate feedback.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons I like being part of this world. Creating wealth is not a zero-sum game, so you don&#8217;t have to stab people in the back to win.</p>

<ol>
<li>You Get No Respect</li>
</ol>


<p>There was one surprise founders mentioned that I&#8217;d forgotten about: that outside the startup world, startup founders get no respect.</p>

<p>In social settings, I found that I got a lot more respect when I said, &#8220;I worked on Microsoft Office&#8221; instead of &#8220;I work at a small startup you&#8217;ve never heard of called x.&#8221;</p>

<p>Partly this is because the rest of the world just doesn&#8217;t get startups, and partly it&#8217;s yet another consequence of the fact that most good startup ideas seem bad:</p>

<p>If you pitch your idea to a random person, 95% of the time you&#8217;ll find the person instinctively thinks the idea will be a flop and you&#8217;re wasting your time (although they probably won&#8217;t say this directly).</p>

<p>Unfortunately this extends even to dating:</p>

<p>It surprised me that being a startup founder does not get you more admiration from women.</p>

<p>I did know about that, but I&#8217;d forgotten.</p>

<ol>
<li>Things Change as You Grow</li>
</ol>


<p>The last big surprise founders mentioned is how much things changed as they grew. The biggest change was that you got to program even less:</p>

<p>Your job description as technical founder/CEO is completely rewritten every 6-12 months. Less coding, more managing/planning/company building, hiring, cleaning up messes, and generally getting things in place for what needs to happen a few months from now.</p>

<p>In particular, you now have to deal with employees, who often have different motivations:</p>

<p>I knew the founder equation and had been focused on it since I knew I wanted to start a startup as a 19 year old. The employee equation is quite different so it took me a while to get it down.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it can become a lot less stressful once you reach cruising altitude:</p>

<p>I&#8217;d say 75% of the stress is gone now from when we first started. Running a business is so much more enjoyable now. We&#8217;re more confident. We&#8217;re more patient. We fight less. We sleep more.</p>

<p>I wish I could say it was this way for every startup that succeeded, but 75% is probably on the high side.</p>

<p>The Super-Pattern</p>

<p>There were a few other patterns, but these were the biggest. One&#8217;s first thought when looking at them all is to ask if there&#8217;s a super-pattern, a pattern to the patterns.</p>

<p>I saw it immediately, and so did a YC founder I read the list to. These are supposed to be the surprises, the things I didn&#8217;t tell people. What do they all have in common? They&#8217;re all things I tell people. If I wrote a new essay with the same outline as this that wasn&#8217;t summarizing the founders&#8217; responses, everyone would say I&#8217;d run out of ideas and was just repeating myself.</p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>

<p>When I look at the responses, the common theme is that starting a startup was like I said, but way more so. People just don&#8217;t seem to get how different it is till they do it. Why? The key to that mystery is to ask, how different from what? Once you phrase it that way, the answer is obvious: from a job. Everyone&#8217;s model of work is a job. It&#8217;s completely pervasive. Even if you&#8217;ve never had a job, your parents probably did, along with practically every other adult you&#8217;ve met.</p>

<p>Unconsciously, everyone expects a startup to be like a job, and that explains most of the surprises. It explains why people are surprised how carefully you have to choose cofounders and how hard you have to work to maintain your relationship. You don&#8217;t have to do that with coworkers. It explains why the ups and downs are surprisingly extreme. In a job there is much more damping. But it also explains why the good times are surprisingly good: most people can&#8217;t imagine such freedom. As you go down the list, almost all the surprises are surprising in how much a startup differs from a job.</p>

<p>You probably can&#8217;t overcome anything so pervasive as the model of work you grew up with. So the best solution is to be consciously aware of that. As you go into a startup, you&#8217;ll be thinking &#8220;everyone says it&#8217;s really extreme.&#8221; Your next thought will probably be &#8220;but I can&#8217;t believe it will be that bad.&#8221; If you want to avoid being surprised, the next thought after that should be: &#8220;and the reason I can&#8217;t believe it will be that bad is that my model of work is a job.&#8221;</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>[1] Graduate students might understand it. In grad school you always feel you should be working on your thesis. It doesn&#8217;t end every semester like classes do.</p>

<p>[2] The best way for a startup to engage with slow-moving organizations is to fork off separate processes to deal with them. It&#8217;s when they&#8217;re on the critical path that they kill you—when you depend on closing a deal to move forward. It&#8217;s worth taking extreme measures to avoid that.</p>

<p>[3] This is a variant of Reid Hoffman&#8217;s principle that if you aren&#8217;t embarrassed by what you launch with, you waited too long to launch.</p>

<p>[4] The question to ask about what you&#8217;ve built is not whether it&#8217;s good, but whether it&#8217;s good enough to supply the activation energy required.</p>

<p>[5] Some VCs seem to understand technology because they actually do, but that&#8217;s overkill; the defining test is whether you can talk about it well enough to convince limited partners.</p>

<p>[6] This is the same phenomenon you see with defense contractors or fashion brands. The dumber the customers, the more effort you expend on the process of selling things to them rather than making the things you sell.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.paulgrahamcn.com/article/selfindulgence">如何失去时间和金钱</a></p>

<p>2010年7月</p>

<p>1998年我们卖掉了自己的创业公司，突然间我有了很多钱。现在我不得不考虑一些以前从未考虑过的事情：如何避免失去这些钱。我知道人有可能由穷变富，也有可能由富变穷。过去几年我一直在研究由穷变富的方法，但我对如何由富变穷几乎一无所知。现在，为了避免由富变穷，我必须找出由富变穷的理由。</p>

<p>所以我开始注意财富是如何失去的。如果当我还是个孩子时你问我富人怎样才会变穷，我肯定会说把钱花掉。书里和电影里都是这些说的，因为这是最明显的方法。但实际上，大部分财富通常不是通过过度消费失去的，而是通过失败的投资。</p>

<p>你很难在毫不留意的情况下花掉一大笔钱。如果你花掉了几万块钱，很有可能会想“哇，我在花掉很多钱”。但如果你从事金融衍生品交易，一眨眼的工夫你就可能失去几百万美元（真的，你想赚多少就有可能赔多少）。</p>

<p>在大部分人看来，花钱购买奢侈品会给自己敲响警钟，而进行失败的投资则不会。买奢侈品看上去是自我放纵。除非你的钱是继承的家产或中彩票得来的，否则你已经很清楚自我放纵会带来麻烦。也正因为如此，很多人在向你推销奢侈品时会说“这是一笔投资”。</p>

<p>解决办法是建立新的警钟。这可能比较麻烦，因为阻止你过度消费的警钟非常基础，甚至它们有可能存在于我们的DNA里，而阻止你进行失败投资的警钟则需要学习，并且有时它们是非常违背直觉的。</p>

<p>几天前，我有一些惊人的发现：时间和金钱面临的情况非常类似。浪费时间最危险的办法不是花时间去享乐，而是花时间假装工作。当你花时间享乐时，你知道你在放纵自己。你的警钟很快就会敲响。如果我早上起来，坐在沙发上看一天电视，我会感到非常不舒服。想一想我都不寒而栗。坐在沙发上看两个小时的电视我都会感到不自在，更别说一整天了。</p>

<p>但我有时候的确会在电视前面坐一天，到一天结束的时候，如果我问自己当天做了什么，答案会是：几乎什么都没做。这样的一天过去后我也会不自在，但和坐在沙发上看一天电视那种感觉不一样。如果我看一整天电视，我会觉得我正在走向堕落。但是当我过完一事无成的一天之后，同样的警钟不会响起，因为从表面上看，我做的那些事情像是真正的工作，比如处理电子邮件。我坐在桌子旁边处理邮件，这并非享乐，那么这肯定是工作。</p>

<p>时间和金钱一样，避免享乐已经无法保护你。这种方法对于保护那些靠打猎采集为生的人或前工业化社会有用。先天因素和后天因素加在一起会让人们避开自我放纵。但是这个世界变得越来越复杂：现在最危险的陷阱是那些看似更加正经，从而可以绕开自我放纵警钟的新型行为。更糟糕的是，这些行为并不会带来乐趣。</p>

<p>================================</p>

<p>How To Lose Time And Money</p>

<p>July 2010</p>

<p>When we sold our startup in 1998 I suddenly got a lot of money. I now had to think about something I hadn&#8217;t had to think about before: how not to lose it. I knew it was possible to go from rich to poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich. But while I&#8217;d spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from poor to rich, I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich to poor. Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they were.</p>

<p>So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost. If you&#8217;d asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I&#8217;d have said by spending all their money. That&#8217;s how it happens in books and movies, because that&#8217;s the colorful way to do it. But in fact the way most fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through bad investments.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to spend a fortune without noticing. Someone with ordinary tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of thousands of dollars without thinking &#8220;wow, I&#8217;m spending a lot of money.&#8221; Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>In most people&#8217;s minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments doesn&#8217;t. Luxuries seem self-indulgent. And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery, you&#8217;ve already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads to trouble. Investing bypasses those alarms. You&#8217;re not spending the money; you&#8217;re just moving it from one asset to another. Which is why people trying to sell you expensive things say &#8220;it&#8217;s an investment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The solution is to develop new alarms. This can be a tricky business, because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes fairly counterintuitive.</p>

<p>A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with time is much the same as with money. The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work. When you spend time having fun, you know you&#8217;re being self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly. If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I&#8217;d feel like something was terribly wrong. Just thinking about it makes me wince. I&#8217;d start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.</p>

<p>And yet I&#8217;ve definitely had days when I might as well have sat in front of a TV all day—days at the end of which, if I asked myself what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically, nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad as I&#8217;d feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV. If I spent a whole day watching TV I&#8217;d feel like I was descending into perdition. But the same alarms don&#8217;t go off on the days when I get nothing done, because I&#8217;m doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work. Dealing with email, for example. You do it sitting at a desk. It&#8217;s not fun. So it must be work.</p>

<p>With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to protect you. It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers, and perhaps all pre-industrial societies. So nature and nurture combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more virtuous types. And the worst thing is, they&#8217;re not even fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.paulgrahamcn.com/article/start">如何开始创业</a></p>

<p>一次成功的创业建立在以下三个条件上：优秀的合伙人，确实有需求的产品，以及尽可能少的启动资金。绝大部分创业失败是因为它们缺少了以上这些条件中的某一项，而那些完全具备这三点的创业往往会取得成功。</p>

<p>让人欣慰的是，当你认真考虑它们的时候，这三点条件都是可行的，虽然可能有一点困难。鉴于成功的创业应该会让创始人富有，我们可以得出结论：富有的生活是可以实现的，只是有一点困难。</p>

<p>如果说在创业方面只有一点我想要澄清的话，那就是：创业时，并没有需要特别出众的才华才能踏出的，神奇的一步。</p>

<p>创意</p>

<p>特别需要指出的是，创业并不需要特别优秀的创意。创业的主旨是通过给人们提供比他们现在拥有的东西更好一点的商品，以次货的需求。可是很多人们现在拥有的产品和服务是如此之差，以至于不需要多聪明的头脑都能想出将之改善的方法。</p>

<p>以Google为例，开始时的计划仅仅是创造一个简单易用不至于烂得让人骂娘的搜索引擎。为此他们做了三点创新：链接更多网页，对搜索结果进行排序，以及使用不带骚扰广告的清新简洁的界面，因此总而言之，他们制作了一个很好用的网站。Google网站的技术含量是无庸置疑的，而总体计划更是直截了当。当现在他们已经有了巨大得多的野心和发展时，这种简单的计划给他们带来一年10亿美元的收益。</p>

<p>世上还有许许多多的领域，和在Google出现之前的网络搜索领域一样落后。我可以想出好几种启发创业思路的方法，不过绝大部分归结于以下的方式：观察人们的某些行为和需求，并找出满足他们需要而又不是太差的一种技术或手段。</p>

<p>举例来说，目前那些约会网站做得比Google出现之前的网络搜索服务还要糟糕得多。他们都使用同样简单的架构，倾向于用数据配对来代替真实世界的约会的重要性，水平甚至还不如一个大学生为了应付课程而做的作业。与此同时，还有很多的资金可以投注到这一领域，约会网站是一个很有价值的生意，并且有可能通过成功的运作得到百倍以上的回报。</p>

<p>一个良好的创意，只是创业的第一步。许多未来的创业者认为，整个创业的过程只是最初的那个主意，以及剩下的执行细节。而风险投资方对此有更清晰的了解，当一个创业者来到风投公司要求用他的创意换取进一步合作的时候，他甚至得不到一份保密协议。很显然，一个纯粹的创意的市场价值，甚至不如签订一份保密协议的成本。</p>

<p>原始创意不值钱的另一个例证是，很多的创业者在其实践过程中对他们原本的计划做了很大的修改。微软创始时的经营计划是贩卖编程语言等软件，而他们现在的商业模式是在创业五年后被IBM扫地出门之后诞生的。</p>

<p>创意绝对是有价值的，但问题在于，它们很难在创业过程中转变为收益。创意不是那种很容易让别人按照你的思路去执行的东西，它们的价值在于其拥有者在实践中对原始计划不断思考和修正的过程。</p>

<p>创意并不是最重要的东西，那些拥有创意的人才是。善于工作的人可以把一个烂主意变好，可是再好好主意也帮不了一个笨蛋。</p>

<p>人</p>

<p>我指的善于工作的人是什么样的呢？在我创业的过程中学到的最有用的东西，就是雇佣员工的标准。你能够明白“猛兽一般的人”这个比喻吗？这句话可能很难翻译成其它语言，不过我认为每个美国人都明白它的意思。这是说，某些人对于他们的工作有点过于认真，以至于他们在工作的过程中跨过了职业需求的限度而进入到狂热的境界。</p>

<p>对于单个人而言，这个比喻确切的意思取决于工作性质的不同：一个绝不接受客人说不的推销员；一个在凌晨四点也不愿意留下代码中的bug去睡觉的黑客；一个会冷不防打电话到纽约时报记者手机的公共关系专家；一个看到两毫米的误差就会觉得浑身不舒服的设计师。</p>

<p>在我的公司里，几乎每个人都是一头猛兽。我的销售主管，那个女人的顽强甚至让我对她电话另一头的潜在客户感到歉意。你都可以感受到他们在电话现那头挣扎，像鱼钩上的鱼一样，但是在签约之前，他们绝对不会得到任何逃跑的机会。</p>

<p>想一想你所认识的人，你会发现“猛兽”形态是很容易找到的。想象某些人的样子，然后在心里描绘下他们做那些“猛兽般”行为的状态。如果你发笑了，说明他们不是那样的人。在一个大公司中，这样的状态可能是不必要甚至不需要的，但在创业中，“猛兽”般的工作态度是绝对必须的。</p>

<p>对于黑客，我们有一些额外的标准。他确实特别聪明吗？如果是，他能够一丝不扣地完成一份工作吗？还有最后，鉴于部分很优秀的黑客会有一些不良癖好，我们是否能够忍受他们和我们一起工作也是指标之一。</p>

<p>而最后的测试只能筛选掉很少一部分人。我们可以接受一个天才的任何缺点，除了不断抱怨的那些。不过这些人通常不怎么优秀，所以我们的第三个测试基本上只是之前的补充。</p>

<p>大部分情况下，当那些讨厌的人努力装聪明的时候，他们会变得让人难以容忍。其实，越是聪明的人越是不会为此感到困扰。所以你会发现，那些充满天才的人总是较易使用“我不知道”“也许你是对的”和“我对xx事情不太了解”这类的句式。</p>

<p>这种技巧并不是一直有用的，因为人很容易受到环境的影响。在MIT的顾客满意部门，好像有一种叫做“装成一个什么都知道的猛男”的传统。听说这种态度最早起源于Marvin Minsky，而与此相类似的所谓典型飞行员姿态，则是来自于Chuck Yeager。就算是真正才华出众的人，在这个环境里也会显得有点太猛，所以你只能忍受他们。</p>

<p>这种人才选择方式让我们拥有Robert Morris了，我所见过最会说“我不知道”的一个人。（至少在他成为MIT的教授之前）。没有人会对Robert有所抱怨，因为他显然比任何人都要聪明，难得的是还没有任何脾气。</p>

<p>就像绝大部分创业活动一样，我们公司最初的合伙人仅仅是一群好朋友，而且连员工的招聘都主要通过朋友关系来进行。这是创业公司和大企业最显著的区别。和某人交几天朋友，能体会到大公司在面试中永远问不出的东西。</p>

<p>创业大半发生在大学周围，是因为那里是有才智的人的聚集地。MIT和斯坦福周围布满了高科技公司，并不是因为他们的学生在课堂上学到的东西。其实只要学校允许，他们宁可在课堂上唱野营歌。</p>

<p>如果你想要创业，和大学里的天才们一起进行会带来更好的机会，所以理论上来说你要努力和你在大学里看到的每一个聪明人交朋友，对吗？答案是不。优秀的技术人员不喜欢目的性很强的交流方式，你的努力不会有回报。</p>

<p>在大学里，你该做的是专注于你自己的项目。就算你不想创业，一个好的技术人员也应该做到这一点，因为这是唯一能够真正学会程序技术的方式。在某些项目里你将会和别的学生合作，而这是最好的结识优秀黑客的方法。有些项目可能会进化成一个值得创业的机会，不过我建议不要对此太过执着。别强制自己做任何事，只要和你欣赏的人一起做喜欢的工作就行了。</p>

<p>理想状态下，你会需要2至4个合作者。只有两个人的创业是很困难的。而单独创业者，将会发现自己面临着巨大的精神压力。即使是比尔大门，传说中无视压力的名人，仍然需要找一个合作者一起创业。不过你确实不需要像一张全家福照片一样多的合作伙伴，一方面是因为创业初期并不需要太多人，另一方面是因为越多人就越多分歧。在只有两三个人的情况下，你们会因为失败的压力迅速地处理不同意见。而7、8个人一起干的时候，任何分歧都可能长时间逗留并造成分裂的小团体。投票表决并不是好方法，全体一致才是创业的需要。</p>

<p>很多情况下，一个新公司都是基于技术型产业而建立，所以创始人需要招收技术人员。在网络泡沫时代，很多商科出身的创业者寻求优秀黑客的帮助来制造他们的产品，其结果被证明并不理想。生意人对于技术问题并不理解，因为他们不知道产品的发展有哪些可选项，会面临什么困难，有什么优势。而且他们也分不清哪个黑客更优秀，就算对于计算机领域的同业，人们也很难分清谁更优秀的问题，而一个单纯的生意人在挑选的时候就更像一场轮盘赌了。</p>

<p>那么在创业时，商科背景的人是否是必须的呢？这个问题并没有确定的答案。当我创业的时候，我们认为是需要的，所以我们向周围的专业人士询问关于“商场的奥秘”的知识以及他们愿不愿意做我们的总经理。不过他们都拒绝了，所以我只能自己来当。不过后来我发现，做生意也没有那么困难和神秘，并不像物理学或者医学那样需要大量的学习，只要努力让别人买你的东西就好了。</p>

<p>我认为，之前我把做生意看成是很神秘的东西，原因在于我本身对它有厌恶感。我希望在纯净而高度脑力化的软件世界中工作，而不是和庸俗的客户及他们的蠢问题打交道。不希望参与某项工作的人往往会用一种保护性的能力不足来作推脱。Paul Erdos是很典型的例子，人们看到他甚至不懂得如何把一颗柚子切成两半。所以别人不得不为他做所有的生活琐事，从而让他能够把自己的全部时间投注在数学商。Erdos是一个极端的例子，不过绝大多数做丈夫的或多或少使用相同的手段。</p>

<p>当我必须放弃我的保护性能力不足之后，我发现做生意并不像我之前想象的那么困难和无聊。生意经中有很深奥的部分，例如税法和衍生产品的定价，但你无需在创业的时候掌握它们。所有创业所需要的知识在任何商学院甚至大学建立起来之前就已经被人们所熟知了。</p>

<p>如果你尝试在福布斯400强的管理者名单中标记出MBA学历的名字，你就会对商学院有新的重要认识。第一个MBA在第22位出现，Phil Knight，Nike的CEO。前50名中只有4个MBA学历，而相对的，福布斯400强中的管理者有相当大一部分是技术背景的。想想Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore，高科技类产业的规则看起来是由技术员而非生意人制定的。所以如果你希望用两年的时间给你未来的创业增添一点资本，学会一点黑客技术看上去比读MBA更有用。</p>

<p>有一个重要理由会让你希望把一个商科背景的人加入到创业的队伍中：总要有个人愿意并且能够关注客户的需求。有些人认为，只有商科背景的人能做这件事。优秀黑客能够制作软件，不过不能设计它们。这种话及其荒谬。黑客没有理由因为懂得设计软件就不理解客户需求，纯正的生意人也没有理由不懂得设计软件却能神奇地理解它们。</p>

<p>无论如何，如果你不能靠自己探寻客户需求，你就必须寻找一个能够这么做的合伙人。这是技术创业中最最重要的一环，绝大部分的创业是因为这个环节而失败的。</p>

<p>客户需求</p>

<p>并不是只有创业公司需要担心客户需求。我认为绝大部分公司失败的主要原因就是他们不能给客户提供想要的东西。以餐馆为例，绝大多数餐馆最终经营失败，其中约有四分之一甚至在第一年就关门大吉。可是你记得曾经有哪一家能做出真正美味的食物的餐馆倒闭吗？</p>

<p>餐馆只要能做出真正美味的食物就足以应付一切。优秀的口味带来高昂的价格，拥挤的人群，喧嚣，热闹的氛围，坐满的座位，甚至态度恶劣的服务，而顾客们还是趋之若鹜。当然确实存在一些口味一般而靠小噱头吸引顾客的餐厅，但这样的经营方式会带来很大的风险。直接提供美味可口的食物才是最为简单有效的方法。</p>

<p>在技术创业中，情况也是一样。你可能听说过创业失败的各种理由，可是有听说过拥有一个极端受欢迎的产品的公司失败的例子么？</p>

<p>几乎每一个失败的创业案例，最终的问题都是其客户失去了对其产品的需求。基本上，所有的失败看起来都是由“资金不足”所直接导致的，可是他们弄不到资金的原因几乎都一样：产品太烂，或者根本就没有一个完成的产品。</p>

<p>当我列出所有创业者都需要做的工作的时候，曾经很想要尽快作出一个产品的第一版。幸好我没有决定这么做，因为这种急功近利的方法不利于做出顾客想要的产品。只有通过发行试用版并根据客户反馈不断调整，才是创造出适合客户需求的产品的唯一方法。</p>

<p>另一个方法是我称为“孤注一掷”(Hail Mary)的策略。你可能对一个产品做出详细的计划书，雇佣一整队的工程师来开发它，一年之后发现你投入的二百万美元变成了一堆没人要的垃圾。在网络泡沫的时代，这种情况并不少见，尤其在那些商业气息很浓的公司进入计算机技术领域的时候，他们都以为开发软件产品是一件可以完美地按照计划进行的事情。</p>

<p>我们从不认同这种做法。作为一个LISP流的黑客，我遵循着快速原型开发的传统。并不是说这种方法是用于开发任何程序（至少不在这篇文章里），不过这种方法对创业阶段需要的软件而言是绝对必要的。</p>

<p>就像大部分创业公司一样，我们进入实际操作阶段以后对我们的计划进行了修改。一开始我们的目标客户是网络咨询公司，可是他们显然不喜欢我们，因为我们的软件使用过于简单又配有自己的站点，他们的客户甚至可以直接把他们炒掉。我们认为还可以做一些网上目录供应商的生意，因为网上销售可以成为他们现有生意的良好扩展。不过在1996年，这种生意很难做。公司的中层管理人往往把网络营销视为一项多出来的工作，而不是一个机会。</p>

<p>我们得到了一些有进取精神的需要目录服务的公司的订单。其中还包括Frederick&#8217;s of Hollywood，那巨大的工作量真是对我们的服务能力的一大考验。不过大部分的客户都是些小公司，希望在网络上寻求机遇的个体商户。有一些客户拥有自己的商店，不过大部分都只在网上销售。所以我们把目标转向这些小商贩来取代原本计划中的网络咨询公司和大型零售商，也因此我们需要把软件做得更简单易用。</p>

<p>从这些经验中，我学会了一个重要原则。使你的技术易于使用是永远值得花精力去做的事。黑客们已经习惯于和电脑打交道所以不了解普通人对于不熟悉的软件怀有的恐惧心理Stephen Hawking（霍金，译注）的编辑告诉他，他每在书里放进一个公式，书的销量就会减少一半。当你致力于使你的技术易于使用时，这条曲线将随着你使软件简化的程度往上倾斜。易用性方面10%的进步，会带来的收益将是两倍的销量而不是仅仅10%的增长。</p>

<p>那要如何探寻客户的需求呢？观察。展销会是观察客户的最佳选择之一，它们往往不是用来争取新客户的，而是用来做市场调查的。在展销会上我们并不仅仅做一些简单的演示，我们还教客户建设自己的网上上铺的方法。同时我们能够观察他们使用我们软件的情况，以及和他们讨论关于产品的进一步需求。</p>

<p>大部分人把创业当成建设一家像苹果或谷歌那样的公司来看待。这些公司名气响亮，人尽皆知。但对于任何一个创业公司来说，在利基市场（类似于细分市场，长尾概念）上或者基础工业领域中还有20个以上可以成就大事业的机会。所以当你希望创业成功的时候，最好把赌注投注在这些方面。</p>

<p>从另一个角度来说，在已经有一个强大的品牌产品的市场中创业，成功的几率是相当小的。在“蓝海”（参见长尾理论）中才有最好的创业机会。因为创业的基本原则是给人们提供比他们现在使用的东西更好一点的产品，所以那些目前水平低下的产业中才蕴藏着最好的机会。相信我，你不会找到一个比大公司的IT部门的工作更烂水平的领域了，那些企业每年花费巨资在使用的软件上，可是回报却是一大堆的麻烦。这种不公平的现象意味着巨大的机遇。</p>

<p>如果你想要找一个创业的机会，你可以尝试找一个中等规模的非技术公司待几个星期，专注于观察他们和电脑应用有关的活动。大部分优秀的黑客都不能够理解普通的公司员工对于电脑的恐惧心理，就像美国的富人们无法理解巴西贫民窟发生了什么一样。</p>

<p>当创业开始的时候，尝试为小公司写一些适合他们的软件，因为这样更容易卖出去。给大公司提供比他们现有的垃圾系统更好一点的垃圾软件，是一件很花时间和金钱的工作。就算你可以用一只手黑掉Oracle的系统，你也不可能竞争过他们的销售人员。所以如果你希望用你较为优秀的技术水平争夺客户，先从小公司做起。</p>

<p>从战略上来说，小公司业务更适合创业中的企业发展。在技术领域，低端产品总能侵蚀高端市场。把一些便宜货改的好一些，其难度远小于把那些更好的软件改的便宜一些。所以低端出身的产品经过市场中的发展和创新，会逐渐地进步到可以打入高端市场的境界。Sun公司的主机就是其中的典范，而Intel在和Sun合作的过程中完成这个过程，微软的Word软件通过插页和设计框架的简单功能打入桌面文件处理软件的竞争中，大众型的数码相机生产商也会制作供给专业人士的昂贵玩具。Avid在录像处理系统中的发展，Apple紧随其后的成长，Henry Ford在已经被遥遥领先的汽车制造业中的成功，都是依靠这种模式。一种便宜而好用的产品，不仅是你创造销售额的利器，而且能够帮助你开拓更大的市场份额。</p>

<p>如果有任何竞争对手的价格和易用性比你的产品优越，那你就要当心成为别人的靶子了。</p>

<p>筹集资金</p>

<p>要使任何创业活动实现，你首先需要的就是启动资金。有些创业公司是自给自足的，比如微软，但绝大部分做不到。我认为明智的做法是寻找适当的投资人，因为依靠自有资金创业，你基本上只能做一个咨询类的公司，而这类型的业务很难转换成一个实业行的事业。</p>

<p>从资本角度考虑，创业就像一场考试。创业致富的方法并不是占有全部的股份，而是尽可能地最大化公司成功的机会。所以较好的做法是用一些股份来换取更高的成功几率。</p>

<p>对于大部分职业黑客而言，寻找投资者是一件神秘而可怕的事情。其实让我说，这只是一项简单乏味的工作。首先你需要几万美元的启动资金来开发你的软件的原型的费用。这种投资称为“种子资金”，只是小额的投资，而获取它们其实也很简单：只要开口问别人行不行就是了。</p>

<p>一般而言，你可以从那些独立投资人那里获取种子资金，这种投资称为“天使投资”，投资人往往是曾经靠技术创业成功的人士。在种子阶段，投资人并不要求你有一个详细的商业计划，他们会根据你的介绍做出快速的决定，有时资金在一周内就会到位——只要一份简单的合同。</p>

<p>我们启动Viaweb的资金是从我们的朋友Julian那里得来的一万美元天使投资，而且他还给了我们更多的帮助。身为企业律师的他曾经是一个公司的ＣＥＯ，所以我们从他那里得到了很多关于做生意的建议，还省去了我们处理自己的法律问题的麻烦。另外，他还带给我们另两位天使投资人，解决了我们下一步的资金问题。</p>

<p>有些天使投资者，尤其是那些有技术背景的人，可能会只凭一个测试版的软件或者一次口头说明就相信你的创业计划。但是大部分投资人都会想要一份详细的计划书来搞明白他们到底投资了什么。</p>

<p>回想起来，当时我们的天使投资人问我要商业计划的时候，我确实为它发了好多的愁。“商业计划”，它显然涉及到“商业”这个新奇的玩意，所以我觉得我得参考一些相关的书籍来学习怎样写好它，但是从书中却完全找不到答案。基本上，投资人会希望你给他们一个大体的描述包括你想做什么和它能怎样赚钱，还有你自己的简历。你只要坐下把你曾经告诉过别人的那些希望写下来就好了。这件事情其实不需要花一整天去做，最重要的是你还能在写下你的计划的过程中得到许多的启发。</p>

<p>得到投资以后，你要做的是建立一家公司。大致上开办一家公司并不困难，但问题在于你很难决定哪些人会成为你的合作伙伴以及你们各占多少股份。两个同等水平的人平分并不困难，但是当你有好几个在工作在不同领域和层次的合伙人的时候，合理分配股份将是无比痛苦的。不过无论如何，只要你们决定好了，这件事情就不能改变。</p>

<p>对于这件事，我没有什么好的建议。我只能说，你该尽力去做，努力做好它。不过实在要说的话，我有一个实践中的经验就是，当每个人都觉得他们得到的股份相对于他们的付出而言算是吃了一点小亏的时候，你的股权分配方式是最好的。</p>

<p>当然除了合作之外，开办一家公司还有很多事情要做。保险，营业执照，劳动补偿，和国税局打交道。我不太清楚还有什么事情在清单上，因为我们的公司完全跳过了这些玩意。。1996年当我们得到了足以创业的投资时，我们也得到了一个了不起的CFO，他把一切安排的妥妥帖帖的。不管怎么说，就算你没有把开办公司时该做的每件事都完成，也不会有人冲过来把你逮捕归案。对于创业者而言这真是天大的好事，不然鬼还敢去创业。</p>

<p>如果你得到投资又不能及时开办公司，你的部分合伙人将会有自己先出去单干的想法。这种事经常发生，而它对你们而言是很危险的。所以当你决定创业并分配好股权的时候，你应该让所有的合伙人签署一份将所有人的创意所有权归属于公司的协议，以保证每个人都只能为公司服务。</p>

<p>(如果我们在演电影，接下来的场景将会伴随着不祥的音乐）</p>

<p>当你这么做的时候，首先你要问清楚每个合伙人他们还签署过什么协议。对于创业公司而言最麻烦的问题之一就是知识产权问题。我们曾经有过，而它差点就把我们搞垮了，比任何一个竞争对手都更接近。。。</p>

<p>当我们正要被别的公司收购的关键时期，我们发现一个合伙人早些时候签署了一份将他的创意所有权交给某大公司以换取进入大学的助学金的协议。理论上来说，这份玩意说明别人在我们的软件产权中占了很大的一份。所以我们不得不对收购行动采取急刹车来应付这一问题。鉴于我们即将被收购，当时我们的现金流降低到一个很低的水平，而这个问题使我们不得不补充资金以维持公司的运行。可是当你们公司头上有知识产权问题存在的时候是很难找到投资者的，没人愿意冒着个险。</p>

<p>我们当时的投资人得知我们现金短缺之后，立刻进行了一些针对性的活动。我并不想在这里详述，除了告诉各位所谓“天使投资”，仅仅是名字好听而已。创始人被要求在留下详细的服务器操作方法给投资人之后离开公司，而当这种事情发生时，收购企业把它当成压价的砝码。</p>

<p>这些问题最后奇迹般地得到解决。投资人回来了；我们的公司得到了新的估价；而那个大公司给出一份对我们的软件不拥有产权的声明；而6个月以后我们被Yahoo以比前一家公司搞得多的价格收购。所以这还算是个皆大欢喜的结局，虽然我的寿命可能因为这次事件被缩短了几年。</p>

<p>别犯我们的错误，在你开始创业之前搞清每个合伙人的知识产权归属问题。</p>

<p>当你建立你的公司以后，可能你会觉得，去敲有钱人家的门，请求他们为你们的小主意提供上万的贷款，是一件很冒昧的事情。不过如果你站在有钱人的立场上看，这件事情是很容易实现的。他们都在寻求良好的投资机会，如果你的项目真的有钱赚，实际上他们很愿意提供资金。甚至他们可能这样想：这家伙会成为下一个Google吗？</p>

<p>通常天使投资金对创业者而言是一桩公平的买卖。他们和你分享股权及远期收益，而他们的股份取决于你对自己公司的预期。如果你用百分之X的股权换取Y的资金，这意味着你对整个公司的定价。例如，如果你用5%股权来换取10万美元，那意味着你的公司的价值是2百万美元。</p>

<p>至于你如何判断自己公司的价值，并没有一个固定的方法。某种意义上来说，创业公司就是一场赌博。当我创业的时候，我并没有认识到这点。Julian认为我们应该把公司定价几百万美元，而我认为把当时我们仅有的几千行代码换算成几百万美元是一件荒唐的事。最后我们把公司定位于100万，因为Julian说没有人回味了价值一百万以下的公司投资。</p>

<p>那时我还没有了解到，我们公司的价值并不取决于我们当时所写的代码。它还取决于我们正确的思路和创意，以及之后我们付出的诸多努力。</p>

<p>筹集资金的下一步是接触真正的风险投资公司。不过不要等到你的钱都快见底了才找他们，风投做出决策是很慢的，他们需要花几个月。而当你和他们周旋的时候，最好不要现金短缺。</p>

<p>从风投那里搞钱比从天时投资人那里搞钱麻烦得多。资金数额通常上百万，所以整场交易需要你更多的时间和精力，来面对更繁重的工作。</p>

<p>有时候风投会希望在公司里设置一个他们选定的CEO，因为他们会觉得你需要一个有商业背景，成熟稳重的领导者。也许有时候这是对的，不过比尔大门兄白手起家的时候又没有经验又没有商科背景，而看上去他混得很好。乔布斯用了一个成熟稳重有商业背景的人来管理他的公司，结果差点毁了它。所以我认为那些所谓成熟稳重有商业背景的家伙们得到了过高的估计。我们曾经把他们称为“播新闻的”，因为他们都梳着干净的头发，用一种深沉而自信的声音讲话，而且除了提词装置上显示的话之外什么都不知道。</p>

<p>我们和不少风投接触过，但最后决定完全依靠天使投资金进行我们的创业。主要是因为我们害怕一个名牌风投公司会用一个新闻播报员来收拾我们。如果他只是在那里摆摆样子，那还好。可要是他想要干涉公司运行怎么办？这将会造成一场灾难，我们的软件太复杂了，他根本不可能弄懂。我们公司的核心价值都在先进的技术上，因此基本上所有的战略决策都是依据与我们的技术发展的，对此我们不需要外行人多嘴多舌。</p>

<p>这也是当时我们的软件没有上市的原因之一。在1998年我们的CFO曾经建议我做这件事。那时候你可以通过做一个类似于狗粮专卖的门户网站来成为一家优秀的售卖有利润的真实产品的上市公司。不过我害怕这会导致我们搞来一个播新闻的，那种所谓“有华尔街腔调的人”。</p>

<p>我很高兴看到Google给了这种趋势一个嘴巴。他们上市的时候根本不理睬所谓的华尔街强调，而华尔街的投资者也不买他们的股票，现在华尔街的所有人都想要踢自己的屁股了。他们会学会重视下次机会的，有利可图的事情他们总是学的很快。</p>

<p>你会有很多的机会和风投们打交道，比你想的要多得多。因为这世界上有很多很多的风头公司，而根据我跟他们打交道的经验——你也会学到的——这完全是个卖方市场。就算现在，市场上也有无穷多的空闲资金在寻找优秀的投资机会。</p>

<p>风投公司是金字塔型的，在顶端有像Sequoia和Kleiner Perkins这样的名人，但是其下有许许多多你听都没听到过的家伙，其共同点就是他们的一块钱就是值一块钱。大部分风投的人会告诉你，他们不仅提供资金，还提供关系和建议，如果你是在和Vinod Khosla或John Doerr或Mike Moritz谈交易，这是没错的。不过这些建议和关系是很昂贵的，而你会发现他们的手下不同层级的人按照职位大小其智商直线下降。从金字塔的顶端下来一点你就会不得不和那些只懂从Wired杂志上获取新知识的银行家谈生意了。（你们的产品使用XML么？）（不明白，程序员才懂的蠢话吧，总之就是火星人的意思，译注）所以我建议你们对所谓的经验和关系的价值保持怀疑态度。基本上，风投只是资金的来源，我倾向于和任何最快提供资金的人谈生意。</p>

<p>你可能不知道该告诉风投多少关于你们的情况。鉴于他们可能有一天投资于你的竞争对手，你应该尽量诚恳。良好的计划不需要藏头露尾，不过也不需要抬头名。总而言之，就像许多风投说的，他们对于创业者的兴趣大于对项目的兴趣。他们和你谈你的计划主要是为了评价你这个人，而不是你的创意。所以只要你表现得明白你在做什么，你也可以保留一点隐私。</p>

<p>和尽量多的风投交流，即使你不想要他们的钱。因为：a）他们可能带来希望收购你的公司的人， b）如果你表现得很强势，他们就不敢投资到你们的竞争对手身上去。如果你只是想让他们认识一下你而不是问他们要钱，接触风投最有效率的方式是，在某些创业公司的展销会上向他们展示。</p>

<p>当你真的得到了启动资金以后，该如何使用呢？尽量节省着用，这是我的建议。几乎每场失败的创业都是直接因为资金断档造成的。当然其中可能有很多深层次的原因，但是这个最的直接原因是我们应该努力避免的。</p>

<p>在网络泡沫时期，几乎每个创业公司都想着“快快搞大”。理想状态下这意味着尽快争取到更多客户，但实际操作的时候却很容易演变成马上雇佣很多员工。就算你能避免如果你能争取到许多客户，那敢情好，可是这种期望往往是不切实际的。人们总是想要第一个进占市场然后囊括所有客户，一点空间都不留给竞争对手。不过我认为在绝大部分生意中先入优势都不会大到这种境界。我们再次以Google为例，当他们创始的时候搜索引擎市场看上去是一个垄断市场，大企业依靠百万美金的营销创立他们的品牌效应：Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista, Inktomi。显然1998年对于加入搜索引擎的竞争是太晚了一点。</p>

<p>不过Google的创始人们发现，品牌在搜索领域几乎没有什么价值可言。你只要在任何一点上能做出更好的产品，用户们就会蜂拥而至。作为对这一观点的佐证，Google从来不打广告。他们就像一家经销商，销售那些自己也乐于使用的产品。</p>

<p>Google超越的那些竞争者们如果将百万美元花在提升软件水平上，可能还会取得更好一些的成绩。对于未来的创业者而言这是一个很好的警示，除非你处于一个产品没有本质差异的市场上，例如香烟雪茄洗涤剂之类，不然，做一大堆广告只说明你的业务正变得越来越差。而网络业务不应该会有什么很类似的产品，那些约会网站猛打广告，正说明他们快要完蛋了。(Fee, fie, fo, fum,我闻到这些公司背后市场营销总监的体味了）</p>

<p>受环境所迫，我们公司的业务成长缓慢，但回头看来却是好事一件。每个创始人都充分掌握了公司的每项工作。除了写软件，我还必须做销售和客户服务的工作。销售业务并不好做，我虽然一直在坚持，但明显我没有一个优秀的推销员所需要的那种耐心和诚恳。我给潜在客户提供的信息是：你不在网上做销售实在太愚蠢了，如果你要在网上做销售，不用我们的软件同样是很愚蠢的。这些信息都是正确的，但显然不能让客人感到愉快。</p>

<p>不过我很擅长做客户服务的工作。想象一下，一个客服不仅对产品知无不详，而且在产品存在bug的时候还会发自内心地道歉，并立刻在和你打电话的时间内修好它。客户们简直爱死我们了，当然我们也很爱他们。因为当你只能通过口耳相传来发展的时候，你的第一批客户一定是那些主动发掘到你的优点的聪明人。在创业的早期阶段，没有什么比有头脑的客户更有价值的了。如果你倾听他们的话，他们能告诉你们很多提升你们产品的竞争力的方法。除了给你这些免费的建议，他们还正在付给你可爱的美金。</p>

<p>我们的公司在1996年正式启动，到年底的时候我们有了大约70个客户。鉴于当时是“快快搞大”的年代，我对我们公司的弱小很是担忧。不过事实上我们的发展方向才是正确的，太快的做大会让你的公司难以转向。第一年是我们提升产品质量的好时机，到了年底的时候我们的产品质量已经远远超过竞争对手的想象了。而且因为每个公司里的黑客们都已经有了充分的客户交流体验，我们对于网络营销的理解远超任何对手。</p>

<p>这些条件是我们创业成功的基石。没有比真正理解你的生意更重要的事了。你可能以为任何做生意的人理所当然的应该理解自己的业务，其实不然。Google成功的秘诀可以简单地归纳为，他们了解搜索业务。当他们创业的时候我正在为Yahoo工作，而我知道Yahoo不明白搜索这件事，因为有一次我尝试告诉公司高层我们拥有更好的搜索系统的必要性，而我从内线得到了这样的回复：我们Yahoo不要再只做一个“搜索引擎”了，搜索业务只是我们网络业务的一小部分，贡献还达不到我们一个月的增长率。我们已经是一家“传媒企业”，“门户网站”，或者其它什么高级玩意，搜索业务有没有都无所谓，就跟脐带一样剪掉也没关系。</p>

<p>确实，搜索业务只是整个页面中很小的一部分，但那是很重要的一部分，因为那是网络服务的起点。我想，Yahoo现在学到这一点了。</p>

<p>绝大部分网络服务商不明白的事，Google却了然于心。第一条就是，就算广告商付钱给你而用户是免费的，你也必须把用户放在广告商之前。我最喜欢的一张保险杠贴纸上写着，“如果群众开始自主，那领导者只能跟随。”。引用到网络业务中，这句话可以改成“争取到所有的用户，广告就会挤破你的门槛”。所以首先要为你的用户设计好你的产品，然后才去考虑如何利用它赚钱。如果你不把用户放在首位，那你的竞争对手将会有机可趁。</p>

<p>你必须了解用户心理，才能创造出他们喜欢的产品。你的公司越大，这件事就越困难。所以我说“慢慢成长”，你花钱花得越慢，你就有越多的时间去研究客户。</p>

<p>另一个节省开支的用意是形成一种勤俭的文化。这是Yahoo也很擅长的一件事。Yahoo的总裁David Filo，却对自己私底下的称号“吝啬鬼”很自豪。我们一到Yahoo就收到了他的Email，他浏览了我们的工作目录之后，询问我们是否真的需要把那么多个人资料存储在公司昂贵的RAID硬盘里。我对此印象深刻，Yahoo作为一家市值十亿级的公司，仍然能够注意硬盘中每一个字节的浪费。</p>

<p>当你从风投哪里弄到几百万美元之后，你可能会感到自己已经挺有钱了。你要搞清楚这只是一种幻觉，那些有丰厚利润的公司才是有钱的公司。资本并不代表利润，那只是投资人希望你用来获取利润的道具。所以除了银行里公司帐户那几百万，你们基本上还是一个穷公司。</p>

<p>创业初期的公司形象，应该是一个刚毕业的大学生，而不是一家律所。以酷和廉价代替昂贵和震撼的视觉效果。我们可以从一家创业公司是否使用Aeron chairs来判断他们是否明白这个道理。在网络泡沫时代，Aeron chairs在创业者中很流行。尤其是当那些公司都使用同样的型号的时候，场面就像一群用风投的钱玩过家家的小朋友。我们公司使用的椅子连扶手都没有，当年看上去有点寒碜，但回头想想，这也是我们在不知情的情况下就作对的重要事情之一。</p>

<p>我们公司处于Harvard Square的一幢木制三层楼中。1970年之前这里是一间公寓，浴室里还有有爪足浴缸的存在。这房子墙壁上用铝箔填充来阻挡宇宙射线的裂缝，代表着它曾经有过某个思路很特别的主人。当某些大人物来访问我们的办公室的时候，我们对于这幢房子的层次确实深感汗颜。不过事实上这里是一个很适合创业公司的地方，我们的角色不是那些平庸的制服组，而是虽然弱小，却勇于开创突破的幼兽。这正是创业者该有的心态。</p>

<p>一幢老式公寓同时也是软件开发的好场所。如果你尝试一下，你会发现分割成立方体的空间很合适编写软件的状态。有没有发现黑客们在家里的小空间比在办公室里工作显得轻松自在得多？那你为何不把办公室弄得像家一样呢。</p>

<p>当你选择创业公司的地点时，不要仅仅挑选那些会让你们看上去比较专业的地方。专业这个词代表优秀的工作成果，而不是电梯和玻璃墙。我建议创业者们尽量避免驻扎在专业办公楼，租一个公寓就好。创业的时候，你会经常想要索性住在办公室里，那何不就弄个可以住的办公室呢。</p>

<p>除了更便宜且便于工作，公寓往往还比办公楼位于更好的地段，在创业中这是很重要的。生产力的关键在于晚饭后的加班。这没有电话铃声骚扰的几个小时是工作出成果的最好时机。当你的员工成群结队地处去吃饭，在餐桌上讨论问题，然后回来解决它们的时候，你们的产品会发生了不起的进化。一旦你的公司进入那种所有人一下班就开个车回郊区的家里吃晚饭的境界，某些特别重要的理念基本上就不复存在了。如果你一开始创业就进入这样的阶段，那你只能求神保佑了。</p>

<p>今天如果我要再次创业，我只会考虑以下三个地点。on the Red Line near Central, Harvard, or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University or California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of campus. 这些我所知仅有的有创业成功希望的地方。</p>

<p>节省开支最重要的方法就是雇佣尽量少的员工。我可能有点极端，但我还是觉得雇佣新员工是一个公司所能做的最烂的事。在创业阶段，人工成本是巨大而令人最为讨厌的经常性开支。雇佣更多的人往往意味着过度的发展，甚至必须搬到一些不适合软件开发工作的地方。而最大的问题是，雇佣更多的人会让你的工作效率降低：以前只要把头伸进某个办公室三言两语解决的问题，现在要找齐八个人一起开个大会。所以你应该雇佣尽可能少的员工。</p>

<p>在网络泡沫时代很多创业公司采用了相反的方法，他们就想着尽快把自己做大，好像没有相关头衔的一个大部门你就没法做任何事情似的。大公司才可以这样做事情。不要雇佣人来填满你未来的组织结构图，雇佣新人的唯一理由是你有些想要做的工作没人能够完成。</p>

<p>既然雇佣不必要的员工又昂贵又没有效率，为什么几乎每个公司都这么干呢？我认为主要是因为人们喜欢有很多人为自己工作的感觉。这是一种劣根性，尤其体现在CEO身上。如果你曾经掌握一家公司，你会发现人们问的最多的问题是你有多少雇员，这是别人判断你的身价的一种方式。不仅仅是一般交往中人们会问，那些写新闻的也会注重这一点。而且他们对于上千人的公司会刮目相看，而10个人的就不屑一顾。</p>

<p>这太荒唐了，如果两家有相同收益的公司，员工数量较少的那家明显经营得更好。当别人问我我创业时有多少员工，我总是回答“20个”，而他们就会摆出那种明显不以为然的表情。我曾经想过加上这么一句“不过我们的主要竞争对手，那个有140个雇员的家伙，一直被我们打得落花流水。要不然我们用这两个数字间比较大的那个来申请贷款你看如何？”</p>

<p>考虑到办公室空间，你的员工数量最好保持在看上去紧凑和真的拥挤之间。任何一个读过大学的聪明人都会明白这个道理。当你创业的时候，别忘了保持这个员工数量。</p>

<p>你有决心么？</p>

<p>问自己以下问题。我应该创业么？我行么？值得冒这个险么？</p>

<p>绝大部分人比他们自己所一直以为的更适合创业这件事，这是我写这篇文章的主要原因。世界上其实有比现在创业的人数更多10倍的潜在创业者，如果他们都进入市场，一切会变得更美好。</p>

<p>我现在才意识到，当时我的确已经是一个很适合创业的人，虽然这个想法曾经让我感到恐惧。作为一个LISP流的黑客，我是被迫创业的，因为我原先打工的咨询公司出了麻烦，而市场上又没有多少使用LISP的公司。因为我实在不能容忍用另一种程序语言写代码（在1995年，所谓另一种语言就是C++），我不的不考虑自己创立一家使用LISP写程序的公司。</p>

<p>我知道这听上去有点不可思议，但如果你也是一个LISP流的黑客你就会明白我的意思了。我在只有创业这一条路的时候才选择开设自己的公司，仅仅因为这件事情本身在当时的我看来太过于困难了。有鉴于此，世上肯定还有很多适合创业的人却因为被这件事困难的外表吓阻而没有这么做。</p>

<p>那么谁应该自己创业呢？一个23到38岁之间，想要一口气解决财政问题而不是在打工的地方无聊地消磨时光的黑客。</p>

<p>我不能给出一个优秀的黑客的定义。在一家一流大学里这个词可能可以指计算机专业排名前50%的学员。但其实你不需要在大学里学计算机就可以做一个黑客，比如我在大学里学的是哲学。</p>

<p>在你还年轻的时候，想要搞明白自己是不是真正优秀的黑客是很困难的。幸运的是，创业的过程会自动地对你们的水平做筛选。技术人员创业的动力在于，或者应该在于以挑剔的眼光看待现存的某项技术，并且发现他们的各种缺点和解决的方法。同时这也是一个优秀黑客所应该具有的特征。</p>

<p>我把创业的下限定于23岁是因为在创业之前，你需要自己看一下别人如何经营他们的公司，而不是因为你的头脑如何如何不成熟。你的学习对象并不一定要选择创业公司。我用了一年时间为一家软件公司工作以偿还我的助学贷款，而这真是我成人后最糟糕的一年。不过虽然当时还没意识到，我确实在那里学到了软件生意中一些很重要的知识。某种意义上来说，那家公司完全是反面典型：没有会议；没有多人掌握的核心代码；没有专门负责销售和运营的人员；不做高端产品；不让人写太长的代码；不理会售后人员对于程序bug的意见；不做最大努力就放弃；不从客户那里吸取教训；不把办公室从Cambridge搬到Route128，等等等等。不过反面教材和正面教材一样有效，甚至更有效。因为灵光一现的创意是很难复制的，但是避免错误却总是可能的。</p>

<p>另一个23岁之前很难创业的理由，是人们不会把太年轻的你当一回事。风投不会相信你的能力，他们只把你当成一个骗取投资的小丑。客户们担心你的信誉，害怕你会突然撒手不管。正常情况下，就连你自己在某些方面都会怀疑自己。雇佣一个比你年长的人是很尴尬的，而21岁就当老板的你可能只想选择21岁以下的家伙，这样当然会更难发现人才。</p>

<p>有些猛人乐于在18岁就开始创业。当比尔盖茨和保罗艾伦一起创办微软的时候，他才19岁。（Paul是22岁，所以这件事情可能不是我们所以为的那样特别。）如果你觉得，无论别人说什么，你都必须立刻开始创业，那就尝试去做吧。</p>

<p>另一头，我选择38岁作为创业的底线，是有很多理由的。首先是因为我觉得自己做老板所需要的体力巨大，很难想象一个将近40的人还能支持住。那时候我能够坚持每天工作到凌晨两三点，而现在我很怀疑自己的体力能不能做到。</p>

<p>另一方面，创业是件冒险的事情。如果你尝试去做，结果在26岁的时候破产了，那还好，许多创业者大约26岁时都破产过。不过38岁的时候，你大概就很难承受这种危险了——尤其是为了你的孩子考虑，如果你有的话。</p>

<p>最后一个问题可能相当沉重。你确定你真的想要自己创业么？从经济角度来考虑，你的职业生涯可能从此走到一条独木桥上。你不再有安稳地工作40年的权力了，取而代之的可能是像地狱一样艰苦的四年。甚至你还可能破产——这件事倒是不需要四年那么久。</p>

<p>在创业的时候，你可能几乎没有时间做工作以外的事情。因为即使在你休息的时候，你的竞争者们也在前进。我唯一的娱乐活动是跑步，因为这是我保持健康的唯一手段，另加上15分钟的睡前阅读。3年中我只有两个月的时候有一个女朋友，而每两星期我去一次二手书店或者去朋友家吃一次晚饭，每星期回父母那里一次。其它时间，全都在工作上了。</p>

<p>鉴于我的合作伙伴都是我的好朋友，工作还算是有趣。在10%的时间里它甚至相当让人喜爱。对于另90%的时间，我能说的只是，事后回头看看它们，还挺有意思的。比如Cambridge断电的6小时，还有我们灾难性的在办公室里使用汽油发电机的尝试，不过我可不想再经历一次。</p>

<p>我并不认为创业的过程会比你的打工生涯发生更多的恶心事件。其实我想总数还要少一点，但是因为它们都挤在一段短短的时间内，所以看上去特别多。所以说，创业给你的最大回报就是时间。如果你在考虑开始做，首先想想你对自由的时间的感觉。如果你是那种不愿意勤恳工作40年，而是希望一次性地解决经济问题的人，那你应该选择创业。</p>

<p>很多人需要在创业和学业之间做出选择。大学生正处于合适的年纪，并且也正是软件业合适的创业人选。你可能会担心开公司会打乱你的学习计划而失去进一步深造的机会。不过在学校里就可以创业，在创业初期边读书边搞公司其实是很简单的。我们的三个创始人中有两个全天在学校里，并且都拿到了文凭。几乎没有什么比一个延期毕业的学生更有冲劲的人了。</p>

<p>如果因为创业你必须离开学校，好歹这种痛苦不会持续太长时间。如果创业是失败的，一般它都会在你失去回到学校的机会之前就结束。如果它成功了，你就不再留恋无聊的助教生涯了。</p>

<p>如果你真的想创业，尽管去做吧。开公司并不是什么难事，你不需要理解什么“做生意的奥秘”之类的玩意。创造一些人们会喜欢使用的东西，然后尽量节省开支保证有钱赚，仅此而已。不是很简单么？</p>

<p>=======================================</p>

<p>How To Start A StartUp</p>

<p>March 2005</p>

<p>(This essay is derived from a talk at the Harvard Computer Society.)</p>

<p>You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible. Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all three are doable. Hard, but doable. And since a startup that succeeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting rich is doable too. Hard, but doable.</p>

<p>If there is one message I&#8217;d like to get across about startups, that&#8217;s it. There is no magically difficult step that requires brilliance to solve.</p>

<p>The Idea</p>

<p>In particular, you don&#8217;t need a brilliant idea to start a startup around. The way a startup makes money is to offer people better technology than they have now. But what people have now is often so bad that it doesn&#8217;t take brilliance to do better.</p>

<p>Google&#8217;s plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that didn&#8217;t suck. They had three new ideas: index more of the Web, use links to rank search results, and have clean, simple web pages with unintrusive keyword-based ads. Above all, they were determined to make a site that was good to use. No doubt there are great technical tricks within Google, but the overall plan was straightforward. And while they probably have bigger ambitions now, this alone brings them a billion dollars a year. [1]</p>

<p>There are plenty of other areas that are just as backward as search was before Google. I can think of several heuristics for generating ideas for startups, but most reduce to this: look at something people are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that doesn&#8217;t suck.</p>

<p>For example, dating sites currently suck far worse than search did before Google. They all use the same simple-minded model. They seem to have approached the problem by thinking about how to do database matches instead of how dating works in the real world. An undergrad could build something better as a class project. And yet there&#8217;s a lot of money at stake. Online dating is a valuable business now, and it might be worth a hundred times as much if it worked.</p>

<p>An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning. A lot of would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is the initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute. Venture capitalists know better. If you go to VC firms with a brilliant idea that you&#8217;ll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosure agreement, most will tell you to get lost. That shows how much a mere idea is worth. The market price is less than the inconvenience of signing an NDA.</p>

<p>Another sign of how little the initial idea is worth is the number of startups that change their plan en route. Microsoft&#8217;s original plan was to make money selling programming languages, of all things. Their current business model didn&#8217;t occur to them until IBM dropped it in their lap five years later.</p>

<p>Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble is, they&#8217;re not transferrable. They&#8217;re not something you could hand to someone else to execute. Their value is mainly as starting points: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinking about.</p>

<p>What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them. Good people can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can&#8217;t save bad people.</p>

<p>People</p>

<p>What do I mean by good people? One of the best tricks I learned during our startup was a rule for deciding who to hire. Could you describe the person as an animal? It might be hard to translate that into another language, but I think everyone in the US knows what it means. It means someone who takes their work a little too seriously; someone who does what they do so well that they pass right through professional and cross over into obsessive.</p>

<p>What it means specifically depends on the job: a salesperson who just won&#8217;t take no for an answer; a hacker who will stay up till 4:00 AM rather than go to bed leaving code with a bug in it; a PR person who will cold-call New York Times reporters on their cell phones; a graphic designer who feels physical pain when something is two millimeters out of place.</p>

<p>Almost everyone who worked for us was an animal at what they did. The woman in charge of sales was so tenacious that I used to feel sorry for potential customers on the phone with her. You could sense them squirming on the hook, but you knew there would be no rest for them till they&#8217;d signed up.</p>

<p>If you think about people you know, you&#8217;ll find the animal test is easy to apply. Call the person&#8217;s image to mind and imagine the sentence &#8220;so-and-so is an animal.&#8221; If you laugh, they&#8217;re not. You don&#8217;t need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, but you need it in a startup.</p>

<p>For programmers we had three additional tests. Was the person genuinely smart? If so, could they actually get things done? And finally, since a few good hackers have unbearable personalities, could we stand to have them around?</p>

<p>That last test filters out surprisingly few people. We could bear any amount of nerdiness if someone was truly smart. What we couldn&#8217;t stand were people with a lot of attitude. But most of those weren&#8217;t truly smart, so our third test was largely a restatement of the first.</p>

<p>When nerds are unbearable it&#8217;s usually because they&#8217;re trying too hard to seem smart. But the smarter they are, the less pressure they feel to act smart. So as a rule you can recognize genuinely smart people by their ability to say things like &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right,&#8221; and &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand x well enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>This technique doesn&#8217;t always work, because people can be influenced by their environment. In the MIT CS department, there seems to be a tradition of acting like a brusque know-it-all. I&#8217;m told it derives ultimately from Marvin Minsky, in the same way the classic airline pilot manner is said to derive from Chuck Yeager. Even genuinely smart people start to act this way there, so you have to make allowances.</p>

<p>It helped us to have Robert Morris, who is one of the readiest to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; of anyone I&#8217;ve met. (At least, he was before he became a professor at MIT.) No one dared put on attitude around Robert, because he was obviously smarter than they were and yet had zero attitude himself.</p>

<p>Like most startups, ours began with a group of friends, and it was through personal contacts that we got most of the people we hired. This is a crucial difference between startups and big companies. Being friends with someone for even a couple days will tell you more than companies could ever learn in interviews. [2]</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that startups start around universities, because that&#8217;s where smart people meet. It&#8217;s not what people learn in classes at MIT and Stanford that has made technology companies spring up around them. They could sing campfire songs in the classes so long as admissions worked the same.</p>

<p>If you start a startup, there&#8217;s a good chance it will be with people you know from college or grad school. So in theory you ought to try to make friends with as many smart people as you can in school, right? Well, no. Don&#8217;t make a conscious effort to schmooze; that doesn&#8217;t work well with hackers.</p>

<p>What you should do in college is work on your own projects. Hackers should do this even if they don&#8217;t plan to start startups, because it&#8217;s the only real way to learn how to program. In some cases you may collaborate with other students, and this is the best way to get to know good hackers. The project may even grow into a startup. But once again, I wouldn&#8217;t aim too directly at either target. Don&#8217;t force things; just work on stuff you like with people you like.</p>

<p>Ideally you want between two and four founders. It would be hard to start with just one. One person would find the moral weight of starting a company hard to bear. Even Bill Gates, who seems to be able to bear a good deal of moral weight, had to have a co-founder. But you don&#8217;t want so many founders that the company starts to look like a group photo. Partly because you don&#8217;t need a lot of people at first, but mainly because the more founders you have, the worse disagreements you&#8217;ll have. When there are just two or three founders, you know you have to resolve disputes immediately or perish. If there are seven or eight, disagreements can linger and harden into factions. You don&#8217;t want mere voting; you need unanimity.</p>

<p>In a technology startup, which most startups are, the founders should include technical people. During the Internet Bubble there were a number of startups founded by business people who then went looking for hackers to create their product for them. This doesn&#8217;t work well. Business people are bad at deciding what to do with technology, because they don&#8217;t know what the options are, or which kinds of problems are hard and which are easy. And when business people try to hire hackers, they can&#8217;t tell which ones are good. Even other hackers have a hard time doing that. For business people it&#8217;s roulette.</p>

<p>Do the founders of a startup have to include business people? That depends. We thought so when we started ours, and we asked several people who were said to know about this mysterious thing called &#8220;business&#8221; if they would be the president. But they all said no, so I had to do it myself. And what I discovered was that business was no great mystery. It&#8217;s not something like physics or medicine that requires extensive study. You just try to get people to pay you for stuff.</p>

<p>I think the reason I made such a mystery of business was that I was disgusted by the idea of doing it. I wanted to work in the pure, intellectual world of software, not deal with customers&#8217; mundane problems. People who don&#8217;t want to get dragged into some kind of work often develop a protective incompetence at it. Paul Erdos was particularly good at this. By seeming unable even to cut a grapefruit in half (let alone go to the store and buy one), he forced other people to do such things for him, leaving all his time free for math. Erdos was an extreme case, but most husbands use the same trick to some degree.</p>

<p>Once I was forced to discard my protective incompetence, I found that business was neither so hard nor so boring as I feared. There are esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax law or the pricing of derivatives, but you don&#8217;t need to know about those in a startup. All you need to know about business to run a startup are commonsense things people knew before there were business schools, or even universities.</p>

<p>If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the name of each person with an MBA, you&#8217;ll learn something important about business school. After Warren Buffett, you don&#8217;t hit another MBA till number 22, Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike. There are only 5 MBAs in the top 50. What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with technical backgrounds. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore. The rulers of the technology business tend to come from technology, not business. So if you want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed in business, the evidence suggests you&#8217;d do better to learn how to hack than get an MBA. [3]</p>

<p>There is one reason you might want to include business people in a startup, though: because you have to have at least one person willing and able to focus on what customers want. Some believe only business people can do this&#8211; that hackers can implement software, but not design it. That&#8217;s nonsense. There&#8217;s nothing about knowing how to program that prevents hackers from understanding users, or about not knowing how to program that magically enables business people to understand them.</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t understand users, however, you should either learn how or find a co-founder who can. That is the single most important issue for technology startups, and the rock that sinks more of them than anything else.</p>

<p>What Customers Want</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just startups that have to worry about this. I think most businesses that fail do it because they don&#8217;t give customers what they want. Look at restaurants. A large percentage fail, about a quarter in the first year. But can you think of one restaurant that had really good food and went out of business?</p>

<p>Restaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what. A restaurant with great food can be expensive, crowded, noisy, dingy, out of the way, and even have bad service, and people will keep coming. It&#8217;s true that a restaurant with mediocre food can sometimes attract customers through gimmicks. But that approach is very risky. It&#8217;s more straightforward just to make the food good.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the same with technology. You hear all kinds of reasons why startups fail. But can you think of one that had a massively popular product and still failed?</p>

<p>In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers didn&#8217;t want the product. For most, the cause of death is listed as &#8220;ran out of funding,&#8221; but that&#8217;s only the immediate cause. Why couldn&#8217;t they get more funding? Probably because the product was a dog, or never seemed likely to be done, or both.</p>

<p>When I was trying to think of the things every startup needed to do, I almost included a fourth: get a version 1 out as soon as you can. But I decided not to, because that&#8217;s implicit in making something customers want. The only way to make something customers want is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on their reactions.</p>

<p>The other approach is what I call the &#8220;Hail Mary&#8221; strategy. You make elaborate plans for a product, hire a team of engineers to develop it (people who do this tend to use the term &#8220;engineer&#8221; for hackers), and then find after a year that you&#8217;ve spent two million dollars to develop something no one wants. This was not uncommon during the Bubble, especially in companies run by business types, who thought of software development as something terrifying that therefore had to be carefully planned.</p>

<p>We never even considered that approach. As a Lisp hacker, I come from the tradition of rapid prototyping. I would not claim (at least, not here) that this is the right way to write every program, but it&#8217;s certainly the right way to write software for a startup. In a startup, your initial plans are almost certain to be wrong in some way, and your first priority should be to figure out where. The only way to do that is to try implementing them.</p>

<p>Like most startups, we changed our plan on the fly. At first we expected our customers to be Web consultants. But it turned out they didn&#8217;t like us, because our software was easy to use and we hosted the site. It would be too easy for clients to fire them. We also thought we&#8217;d be able to sign up a lot of catalog companies, because selling online was a natural extension of their existing business. But in 1996 that was a hard sell. The middle managers we talked to at catalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but as something that meant more work for them.</p>

<p>We did get a few of the more adventurous catalog companies. Among them was Frederick&#8217;s of Hollywood, which gave us valuable experience dealing with heavy loads on our servers. But most of our users were small, individual merchants who saw the Web as an opportunity to build a business. Some had retail stores, but many only existed online. And so we changed direction to focus on these users. Instead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalog companies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.</p>

<p>I learned something valuable from that. It&#8217;s worth trying very, very hard to make technology easy to use. Hackers are so used to computers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to normal people. Stephen Hawking&#8217;s editor told him that every equation he included in his book would cut sales in half. When you work on making technology easier to use, you&#8217;re riding that curve up instead of down. A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn&#8217;t just increase your sales 10%. It&#8217;s more likely to double your sales.</p>

<p>How do you figure out what customers want? Watch them. One of the best places to do this was at trade shows. Trade shows didn&#8217;t pay as a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as market research. We didn&#8217;t just give canned presentations at trade shows. We used to show people how to build real, working stores. Which meant we got to watch as they used our software, and talk to them about what they needed.</p>

<p>No matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a stretch for you, the founders, to understand what users want. The only kind of software you can build without studying users is the sort for which you are the typical user. But this is just the kind that tends to be open source: operating systems, programming languages, editors, and so on. So if you&#8217;re developing technology for money, you&#8217;re probably not going to be developing it for people like you. Indeed, you can use this as a way to generate ideas for startups: what do people who are not like you want from technology?</p>

<p>When most people think of startups, they think of companies like Apple or Google. Everyone knows these, because they&#8217;re big consumer brands. But for every startup like that, there are twenty more that operate in niche markets or live quietly down in the infrastructure. So if you start a successful startup, odds are you&#8217;ll start one of those.</p>

<p>Another way to say that is, if you try to start the kind of startup that has to be a big consumer brand, the odds against succeeding are steeper. The best odds are in niche markets. Since startups make money by offering people something better than they had before, the best opportunities are where things suck most. And it would be hard to find a place where things suck more than in corporate IT departments. You would not believe the amount of money companies spend on software, and the crap they get in return. This imbalance equals opportunity.</p>

<p>If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a couple weeks just watching what they do with computers. Most good hackers have no more idea of the horrors perpetrated in these places than rich Americans do of what goes on in Brazilian slums.</p>

<p>Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it&#8217;s easier to sell to them. It&#8217;s worth so much to sell stuff to big companies that the people selling them the crap they currently use spend a lot of time and money to do it. And while you can outhack Oracle with one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can&#8217;t outsell an Oracle salesman. So if you want to win through better technology, aim at smaller customers. [4]</p>

<p>They&#8217;re the more strategically valuable part of the market anyway. In technology, the low end always eats the high end. It&#8217;s easier to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful product cheaper. So the products that start as cheap, simple options tend to gradually grow more powerful till, like water rising in a room, they squash the &#8220;high-end&#8221; products against the ceiling. Sun did this to mainframes, and Intel is doing it to Sun. Microsoft Word did it to desktop publishing software like Interleaf and Framemaker. Mass-market digital cameras are doing it to the expensive models made for professionals. Avid did it to the manufacturers of specialized video editing systems, and now Apple is doing it to Avid. Henry Ford did it to the car makers that preceded him. If you build the simple, inexpensive option, you&#8217;ll not only find it easier to sell at first, but you&#8217;ll also be in the best position to conquer the rest of the market.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very dangerous to let anyone fly under you. If you have the cheapest, easiest product, you&#8217;ll own the low end. And if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re in the crosshairs of whoever does.</p>

<p>Raising Money</p>

<p>To make all this happen, you&#8217;re going to need money. Some startups have been self-funding&#8211; Microsoft for example&#8211; but most aren&#8217;t. I think it&#8217;s wise to take money from investors. To be self-funding, you have to start as a consulting company, and it&#8217;s hard to switch from that to a product company.</p>

<p>Financially, a startup is like a pass/fail course. The way to get rich from a startup is to maximize the company&#8217;s chances of succeeding, not to maximize the amount of stock you retain. So if you can trade stock for something that improves your odds, it&#8217;s probably a smart move.</p>

<p>To most hackers, getting investors seems like a terrifying and mysterious process. Actually it&#8217;s merely tedious. I&#8217;ll try to give an outline of how it works.</p>

<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll need is a few tens of thousands of dollars to pay your expenses while you develop a prototype. This is called seed capital. Because so little money is involved, raising seed capital is comparatively easy&#8211; at least in the sense of getting a quick yes or no.</p>

<p>Usually you get seed money from individual rich people called &#8220;angels.&#8221; Often they&#8217;re people who themselves got rich from technology. At the seed stage, investors don&#8217;t expect you to have an elaborate business plan. Most know that they&#8217;re supposed to decide quickly. It&#8217;s not unusual to get a check within a week based on a half-page agreement.</p>

<p>We started Viaweb with $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian. But he gave us a lot more than money. He&#8217;s a former CEO and also a corporate lawyer, so he gave us a lot of valuable advice about business, and also did all the legal work of getting us set up as a company. Plus he introduced us to one of the two angel investors who supplied our next round of funding.</p>

<p>Some angels, especially those with technology backgrounds, may be satisfied with a demo and a verbal description of what you plan to do. But many will want a copy of your business plan, if only to remind themselves what they invested in.</p>

<p>Our angels asked for one, and looking back, I&#8217;m amazed how much worry it caused me. &#8220;Business plan&#8221; has that word &#8220;business&#8221; in it, so I figured it had to be something I&#8217;d have to read a book about business plans to write. Well, it doesn&#8217;t. At this stage, all most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan to do and how you&#8217;re going to make money from it, and the resumes of the founders. If you just sit down and write out what you&#8217;ve been saying to one another, that should be fine. It shouldn&#8217;t take more than a couple hours, and you&#8217;ll probably find that writing it all down gives you more ideas about what to do.</p>

<p>For the angel to have someone to make the check out to, you&#8217;re going to have to have some kind of company. Merely incorporating yourselves isn&#8217;t hard. The problem is, for the company to exist, you have to decide who the founders are, and how much stock they each have. If there are two founders with the same qualifications who are both equally committed to the business, that&#8217;s easy. But if you have a number of people who are expected to contribute in varying degrees, arranging the proportions of stock can be hard. And once you&#8217;ve done it, it tends to be set in stone.</p>

<p>I have no tricks for dealing with this problem. All I can say is, try hard to do it right. I do have a rule of thumb for recognizing when you have, though. When everyone feels they&#8217;re getting a slightly bad deal, that they&#8217;re doing more than they should for the amount of stock they have, the stock is optimally apportioned.</p>

<p>There is more to setting up a company than incorporating it, of course: insurance, business license, unemployment compensation, various things with the IRS. I&#8217;m not even sure what the list is, because we, ah, skipped all that. When we got real funding near the end of 1996, we hired a great CFO, who fixed everything retroactively. It turns out that no one comes and arrests you if you don&#8217;t do everything you&#8217;re supposed to when starting a company. And a good thing too, or a lot of startups would never get started. [5]</p>

<p>It can be dangerous to delay turning yourself into a company, because one or more of the founders might decide to split off and start another company doing the same thing. This does happen. So when you set up the company, as well as as apportioning the stock, you should get all the founders to sign something agreeing that everyone&#8217;s ideas belong to this company, and that this company is going to be everyone&#8217;s only job.</p>

<p>[If this were a movie, ominous music would begin here.]</p>

<p>While you&#8217;re at it, you should ask what else they&#8217;ve signed. One of the worst things that can happen to a startup is to run into intellectual property problems. We did, and it came closer to killing us than any competitor ever did.</p>

<p>As we were in the middle of getting bought, we discovered that one of our people had, early on, been bound by an agreement that said all his ideas belonged to the giant company that was paying for him to go to grad school. In theory, that could have meant someone else owned big chunks of our software. So the acquisition came to a screeching halt while we tried to sort this out. The problem was, since we&#8217;d been about to be acquired, we&#8217;d allowed ourselves to run low on cash. Now we needed to raise more to keep going. But it&#8217;s hard to raise money with an IP cloud over your head, because investors can&#8217;t judge how serious it is.</p>

<p>Our existing investors, knowing that we needed money and had nowhere else to get it, at this point attempted certain gambits which I will not describe in detail, except to remind readers that the word &#8220;angel&#8221; is a metaphor. The founders thereupon proposed to walk away from the company, after giving the investors a brief tutorial on how to administer the servers themselves. And while this was happening, the acquirers used the delay as an excuse to welch on the deal.</p>

<p>Miraculously it all turned out ok. The investors backed down; we did another round of funding at a reasonable valuation; the giant company finally gave us a piece of paper saying they didn&#8217;t own our software; and six months later we were bought by Yahoo for much more than the earlier acquirer had agreed to pay. So we were happy in the end, though the experience probably took several years off my life.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t do what we did. Before you consummate a startup, ask everyone about their previous IP history.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve got a company set up, it may seem presumptuous to go knocking on the doors of rich people and asking them to invest tens of thousands of dollars in something that is really just a bunch of guys with some ideas. But when you look at it from the rich people&#8217;s point of view, the picture is more encouraging. Most rich people are looking for good investments. If you really think you have a chance of succeeding, you&#8217;re doing them a favor by letting them invest. Mixed with any annoyance they might feel about being approached will be the thought: are these guys the next Google?</p>

<p>Usually angels are financially equivalent to founders. They get the same kind of stock and get diluted the same amount in future rounds. How much stock should they get? That depends on how ambitious you feel. When you offer x percent of your company for y dollars, you&#8217;re implicitly claiming a certain value for the whole company. Venture investments are usually described in terms of that number. If you give an investor new shares equal to 5% of those already outstanding in return for $100,000, then you&#8217;ve done the deal at a pre-money valuation of $2 million.</p>

<p>How do you decide what the value of the company should be? There is no rational way. At this stage the company is just a bet. I didn&#8217;t realize that when we were raising money. Julian thought we ought to value the company at several million dollars. I thought it was preposterous to claim that a couple thousand lines of code, which was all we had at the time, were worth several million dollars. Eventually we settled on one millon, because Julian said no one would invest in a company with a valuation any lower. [6]</p>

<p>What I didn&#8217;t grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn&#8217;t just the value of the code we&#8217;d written so far. It was also the value of our ideas, which turned out to be right, and of all the future work we&#8217;d do, which turned out to be a lot.</p>

<p>The next round of funding is the one in which you might deal with actual venture capital firms. But don&#8217;t wait till you&#8217;ve burned through your last round of funding to start approaching them. VCs are slow to make up their minds. They can take months. You don&#8217;t want to be running out of money while you&#8217;re trying to negotiate with them.</p>

<p>Getting money from an actual VC firm is a bigger deal than getting money from angels. The amounts of money involved are larger, millions usually. So the deals take longer, dilute you more, and impose more onerous conditions.</p>

<p>Sometimes the VCs want to install a new CEO of their own choosing. Usually the claim is that you need someone mature and experienced, with a business background. Maybe in some cases this is true. And yet Bill Gates was young and inexperienced and had no business background, and he seems to have done ok. Steve Jobs got booted out of his own company by someone mature and experienced, with a business background, who then proceeded to ruin the company. So I think people who are mature and experienced, with a business background, may be overrated. We used to call these guys &#8220;newscasters,&#8221; because they had neat hair and spoke in deep, confident voices, and generally didn&#8217;t know much more than they read on the teleprompter.</p>

<p>We talked to a number of VCs, but eventually we ended up financing our startup entirely with angel money. The main reason was that we feared a brand-name VC firm would stick us with a newscaster as part of the deal. That might have been ok if he was content to limit himself to talking to the press, but what if he wanted to have a say in running the company? That would have led to disaster, because our software was so complex. We were a company whose whole m.o. was to win through better technology. The strategic decisions were mostly decisions about technology, and we didn&#8217;t need any help with those.</p>

<p>This was also one reason we didn&#8217;t go public. Back in 1998 our CFO tried to talk me into it. In those days you could go public as a dogfood portal, so as a company with a real product and real revenues, we might have done well. But I feared it would have meant taking on a newscaster&#8211; someone who, as they say, &#8220;can talk Wall Street&#8217;s language.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m happy to see Google is bucking that trend. They didn&#8217;t talk Wall Street&#8217;s language when they did their IPO, and Wall Street didn&#8217;t buy. And now Wall Street is collectively kicking itself. They&#8217;ll pay attention next time. Wall Street learns new languages fast when money is involved.</p>

<p>You have more leverage negotiating with VCs than you realize. The reason is other VCs. I know a number of VCs now, and when you talk to them you realize that it&#8217;s a seller&#8217;s market. Even now there is too much money chasing too few good deals.</p>

<p>VCs form a pyramid. At the top are famous ones like Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins, but beneath those are a huge number you&#8217;ve never heard of. What they all have in common is that a dollar from them is worth one dollar. Most VCs will tell you that they don&#8217;t just provide money, but connections and advice. If you&#8217;re talking to Vinod Khosla or John Doerr or Mike Moritz, this is true. But such advice and connections can come very expensive. And as you go down the food chain the VCs get rapidly dumber. A few steps down from the top you&#8217;re basically talking to bankers who&#8217;ve picked up a few new vocabulary words from reading Wired. (Does your product use XML?) So I&#8217;d advise you to be skeptical about claims of experience and connections. Basically, a VC is a source of money. I&#8217;d be inclined to go with whoever offered the most money the soonest with the least strings attached.</p>

<p>You may wonder how much to tell VCs. And you should, because some of them may one day be funding your competitors. I think the best plan is not to be overtly secretive, but not to tell them everything either. After all, as most VCs say, they&#8217;re more interested in the people than the ideas. The main reason they want to talk about your idea is to judge you, not the idea. So as long as you seem like you know what you&#8217;re doing, you can probably keep a few things back from them. [7]</p>

<p>Talk to as many VCs as you can, even if you don&#8217;t want their money, because a) they may be on the board of someone who will buy you, and b) if you seem impressive, they&#8217;ll be discouraged from investing in your competitors. The most efficient way to reach VCs, especially if you only want them to know about you and don&#8217;t want their money, is at the conferences that are occasionally organized for startups to present to them.</p>

<p>Not Spending It</p>

<p>When and if you get an infusion of real money from investors, what should you do with it? Not spend it, that&#8217;s what. In nearly every startup that fails, the proximate cause is running out of money. Usually there is something deeper wrong. But even a proximate cause of death is worth trying hard to avoid.</p>

<p>During the Bubble many startups tried to &#8220;get big fast.&#8221; Ideally this meant getting a lot of customers fast. But it was easy for the meaning to slide over into hiring a lot of people fast.</p>

<p>Of the two versions, the one where you get a lot of customers fast is of course preferable. But even that may be overrated. The idea is to get there first and get all the users, leaving none for competitors. But I think in most businesses the advantages of being first to market are not so overwhelmingly great. Google is again a case in point. When they appeared it seemed as if search was a mature market, dominated by big players who&#8217;d spent millions to build their brands: Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista, Inktomi. Surely 1998 was a little late to arrive at the party.</p>

<p>But as the founders of Google knew, brand is worth next to nothing in the search business. You can come along at any point and make something better, and users will gradually seep over to you. As if to emphasize the point, Google never did any advertising. They&#8217;re like dealers; they sell the stuff, but they know better than to use it themselves.</p>

<p>The competitors Google buried would have done better to spend those millions improving their software. Future startups should learn from that mistake. Unless you&#8217;re in a market where products are as undifferentiated as cigarettes or vodka or laundry detergent, spending a lot on brand advertising is a sign of breakage. And few if any Web businesses are so undifferentiated. The dating sites are running big ad campaigns right now, which is all the more evidence they&#8217;re ripe for the picking. (Fee, fie, fo, fum, I smell a company run by marketing guys.)</p>

<p>We were compelled by circumstances to grow slowly, and in retrospect it was a good thing. The founders all learned to do every job in the company. As well as writing software, I had to do sales and customer support. At sales I was not very good. I was persistent, but I didn&#8217;t have the smoothness of a good salesman. My message to potential customers was: you&#8217;d be stupid not to sell online, and if you sell online you&#8217;d be stupid to use anyone else&#8217;s software. Both statements were true, but that&#8217;s not the way to convince people.</p>

<p>I was great at customer support though. Imagine talking to a customer support person who not only knew everything about the product, but would apologize abjectly if there was a bug, and then fix it immediately, while you were on the phone with them. Customers loved us. And we loved them, because when you&#8217;re growing slow by word of mouth, your first batch of users are the ones who were smart enough to find you by themselves. There is nothing more valuable, in the early stages of a startup, than smart users. If you listen to them, they&#8217;ll tell you exactly how to make a winning product. And not only will they give you this advice for free, they&#8217;ll pay you.</p>

<p>We officially launched in early 1996. By the end of that year we had about 70 users. Since this was the era of &#8220;get big fast,&#8221; I worried about how small and obscure we were. But in fact we were doing exactly the right thing. Once you get big (in users or employees) it gets hard to change your product. That year was effectively a laboratory for improving our software. By the end of it, we were so far ahead of our competitors that they never had a hope of catching up. And since all the hackers had spent many hours talking to users, we understood online commerce way better than anyone else.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the key to success as a startup. There is nothing more important than understanding your business. You might think that anyone in a business must, ex officio, understand it. Far from it. Google&#8217;s secret weapon was simply that they understood search. I was working for Yahoo when Google appeared, and Yahoo didn&#8217;t understand search. I know because I once tried to convince the powers that be that we had to make search better, and I got in reply what was then the party line about it: that Yahoo was no longer a mere &#8220;search engine.&#8221; Search was now only a small percentage of our page views, less than one month&#8217;s growth, and now that we were established as a &#8220;media company,&#8221; or &#8220;portal,&#8221; or whatever we were, search could safely be allowed to wither and drop off, like an umbilical cord.</p>

<p>Well, a small fraction of page views they may be, but they are an important fraction, because they are the page views that Web sessions start with. I think Yahoo gets that now.</p>

<p>Google understands a few other things most Web companies still don&#8217;t. The most important is that you should put users before advertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users aren&#8217;t. One of my favorite bumper stickers reads &#8220;if the people lead, the leaders will follow.&#8221; Paraphrased for the Web, this becomes &#8220;get all the users, and the advertisers will follow.&#8221; More generally, design your product to please users first, and then think about how to make money from it. If you don&#8217;t put users first, you leave a gap for competitors who do.</p>

<p>To make something users love, you have to understand them. And the bigger you are, the harder that is. So I say &#8220;get big slow.&#8221; The slower you burn through your funding, the more time you have to learn.</p>

<p>The other reason to spend money slowly is to encourage a culture of cheapness. That&#8217;s something Yahoo did understand. David Filo&#8217;s title was &#8220;Chief Yahoo,&#8221; but he was proud that his unofficial title was &#8220;Cheap Yahoo.&#8221; Soon after we arrived at Yahoo, we got an email from Filo, who had been crawling around our directory hierarchy, asking if it was really necessary to store so much of our data on expensive RAID drives. I was impressed by that. Yahoo&#8217;s market cap then was already in the billions, and they were still worrying about wasting a few gigs of disk space.</p>

<p>When you get a couple million dollars from a VC firm, you tend to feel rich. It&#8217;s important to realize you&#8217;re not. A rich company is one with large revenues. This money isn&#8217;t revenue. It&#8217;s money investors have given you in the hope you&#8217;ll be able to generate revenues. So despite those millions in the bank, you&#8217;re still poor.</p>

<p>For most startups the model should be grad student, not law firm. Aim for cool and cheap, not expensive and impressive. For us the test of whether a startup understood this was whether they had Aeron chairs. The Aeron came out during the Bubble and was very popular with startups. Especially the type, all too common then, that was like a bunch of kids playing house with money supplied by VCs. We had office chairs so cheap that the arms all fell off. This was slightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studenty atmosphere of our office was another of those things we did right without knowing it.</p>

<p>Our offices were in a wooden triple-decker in Harvard Square. It had been an apartment until about the 1970s, and there was still a claw-footed bathtub in the bathroom. It must once have been inhabited by someone fairly eccentric, because a lot of the chinks in the walls were stuffed with aluminum foil, as if to protect against cosmic rays. When eminent visitors came to see us, we were a bit sheepish about the low production values. But in fact that place was the perfect space for a startup. We felt like our role was to be impudent underdogs instead of corporate stuffed shirts, and that is exactly the spirit you want.</p>

<p>An apartment is also the right kind of place for developing software. Cube farms suck for that, as you&#8217;ve probably discovered if you&#8217;ve tried it. Ever notice how much easier it is to hack at home than at work? So why not make work more like home?</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re looking for space for a startup, don&#8217;t feel that it has to look professional. Professional means doing good work, not elevators and glass walls. I&#8217;d advise most startups to avoid corporate space at first and just rent an apartment. You want to live at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designed to be lived in as your office?</p>

<p>Besides being cheaper and better to work in, apartments tend to be in better locations than office buildings. And for a startup location is very important. The key to productivity is for people to come back to work after dinner. Those hours after the phone stops ringing are by far the best for getting work done. Great things happen when a group of employees go out to dinner together, talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement them. So you want to be in a place where there are a lot of restaurants around, not some dreary office park that&#8217;s a wasteland after 6:00 PM. Once a company shifts over into the model where everyone drives home to the suburbs for dinner, however late, you&#8217;ve lost something extraordinarily valuable. God help you if you actually start in that mode.</p>

<p>If I were going to start a startup today, there are only three places I&#8217;d consider doing it: on the Red Line near Central, Harvard, or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University or California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of campus. These are the only places I know that have the right kind of vibe.</p>

<p>The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people. I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing a company can do. To start with, people are a recurring expense, which is the worst kind. They also tend to cause you to grow out of your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office building that will make your software worse. But worst of all, they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone&#8217;s office and checking out an idea with them, eight people have to have a meeting about it. So the fewer people you can hire, the better.</p>

<p>During the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy. They wanted to get &#8220;staffed up&#8221; as soon as possible, as if you couldn&#8217;t get anything done unless there was someone with the corresponding job title. That&#8217;s big company thinking. Don&#8217;t hire people to fill the gaps in some a priori org chart. The only reason to hire someone is to do something you&#8217;d like to do but can&#8217;t.</p>

<p>If hiring unnecessary people is expensive and slows you down, why do nearly all companies do it? I think the main reason is that people like the idea of having a lot of people working for them. This weakness often extends right up to the CEO. If you ever end up running a company, you&#8217;ll find the most common question people ask is how many employees you have. This is their way of weighing you. It&#8217;s not just random people who ask this; even reporters do. And they&#8217;re going to be a lot more impressed if the answer is a thousand than if it&#8217;s ten.</p>

<p>This is ridiculous, really. If two companies have the same revenues, it&#8217;s the one with fewer employees that&#8217;s more impressive. When people used to ask me how many people our startup had, and I answered &#8220;twenty,&#8221; I could see them thinking that we didn&#8217;t count for much. I used to want to add &#8220;but our main competitor, whose ass we regularly kick, has a hundred and forty, so can we have credit for the larger of the two numbers?&#8221;</p>

<p>As with office space, the number of your employees is a choice between seeming impressive, and being impressive. Any of you who were nerds in high school know about this choice. Keep doing it when you start a company.</p>

<p>Should You?</p>

<p>But should you start a company? Are you the right sort of person to do it? If you are, is it worth it?</p>

<p>More people are the right sort of person to start a startup than realize it. That&#8217;s the main reason I wrote this. There could be ten times more startups than there are, and that would probably be a good thing.</p>

<p>I was, I now realize, exactly the right sort of person to start a startup. But the idea terrified me at first. I was forced into it because I was a Lisp hacker. The company I&#8217;d been consulting for seemed to be running into trouble, and there were not a lot of other companies using Lisp. Since I couldn&#8217;t bear the thought of programming in another language (this was 1995, remember, when &#8220;another language&#8221; meant C++) the only option seemed to be to start a new company using Lisp.</p>

<p>I realize this sounds far-fetched, but if you&#8217;re a Lisp hacker you&#8217;ll know what I mean. And if the idea of starting a startup frightened me so much that I only did it out of necessity, there must be a lot of people who would be good at it but who are too intimidated to try.</p>

<p>So who should start a startup? Someone who is a good hacker, between about 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one shot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working life.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say precisely what a good hacker is. At a first rate university this might include the top half of computer science majors. Though of course you don&#8217;t have to be a CS major to be a hacker; I was a philosophy major in college.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell whether you&#8217;re a good hacker, especially when you&#8217;re young. Fortunately the process of starting startups tends to select them automatically. What drives people to start startups is (or should be) looking at existing technology and thinking, don&#8217;t these guys realize they should be doing x, y, and z? And that&#8217;s also a sign that one is a good hacker.</p>

<p>I put the lower bound at 23 not because there&#8217;s something that doesn&#8217;t happen to your brain till then, but because you need to see what it&#8217;s like in an existing business before you try running your own. The business doesn&#8217;t have to be a startup. I spent a year working for a software company to pay off my college loans. It was the worst year of my adult life, but I learned, without realizing it at the time, a lot of valuable lessons about the software business. In this case they were mostly negative lessons: don&#8217;t have a lot of meetings; don&#8217;t have chunks of code that multiple people own; don&#8217;t have a sales guy running the company; don&#8217;t make a high-end product; don&#8217;t let your code get too big; don&#8217;t leave finding bugs to QA people; don&#8217;t go too long between releases; don&#8217;t isolate developers from users; don&#8217;t move from Cambridge to Route 128; and so on. [8] But negative lessons are just as valuable as positive ones. Perhaps even more valuable: it&#8217;s hard to repeat a brilliant performance, but it&#8217;s straightforward to avoid errors. [9]</p>

<p>The other reason it&#8217;s hard to start a company before 23 is that people won&#8217;t take you seriously. VCs won&#8217;t trust you, and will try to reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding. Customers will worry you&#8217;re going to flake out and leave them stranded. Even you yourself, unless you&#8217;re very unusual, will feel your age to some degree; you&#8217;ll find it awkward to be the boss of someone much older than you, and if you&#8217;re 21, hiring only people younger rather limits your options.</p>

<p>Some people could probably start a company at 18 if they wanted to. Bill Gates was 19 when he and Paul Allen started Microsoft. (Paul Allen was 22, though, and that probably made a difference.) So if you&#8217;re thinking, I don&#8217;t care what he says, I&#8217;m going to start a company now, you may be the sort of person who could get away with it.</p>

<p>The other cutoff, 38, has a lot more play in it. One reason I put it there is that I don&#8217;t think many people have the physical stamina much past that age. I used to work till 2:00 or 3:00 AM every night, seven days a week. I don&#8217;t know if I could do that now.</p>

<p>Also, startups are a big risk financially. If you try something that blows up and leaves you broke at 26, big deal; a lot of 26 year olds are broke. By 38 you can&#8217;t take so many risks&#8211; especially if you have kids.</p>

<p>My final test may be the most restrictive. Do you actually want to start a startup? What it amounts to, economically, is compressing your working life into the smallest possible space. Instead of working at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for four. And maybe end up with nothing&#8211; though in that case it probably won&#8217;t take four years.</p>

<p>During this time you&#8217;ll do little but work, because when you&#8217;re not working, your competitors will be. My only leisure activities were running, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, and about fifteen minutes of reading a night. I had a girlfriend for a total of two months during that three year period. Every couple weeks I would take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a friend&#8217;s house for dinner. I went to visit my family twice. Otherwise I just worked.</p>

<p>Working was often fun, because the people I worked with were some of my best friends. Sometimes it was even technically interesting. But only about 10% of the time. The best I can say for the other 90% is that some of it is funnier in hindsight than it seemed then. Like the time the power went off in Cambridge for about six hours, and we made the mistake of trying to start a gasoline powered generator inside our offices. I won&#8217;t try that again.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think the amount of bullshit you have to deal with in a startup is more than you&#8217;d endure in an ordinary working life. It&#8217;s probably less, in fact; it just seems like a lot because it&#8217;s compressed into a short period. So mainly what a startup buys you is time. That&#8217;s the way to think about it if you&#8217;re trying to decide whether to start one. If you&#8217;re the sort of person who would like to solve the money problem once and for all instead of working for a salary for 40 years, then a startup makes sense.</p>

<p>For a lot of people the conflict is between startups and graduate school. Grad students are just the age, and just the sort of people, to start software startups. You may worry that if you do you&#8217;ll blow your chances of an academic career. But it&#8217;s possible to be part of a startup and stay in grad school, especially at first. Two of our three original hackers were in grad school the whole time, and both got their degrees. There are few sources of energy so powerful as a procrastinating grad student.</p>

<p>If you do have to leave grad school, in the worst case it won&#8217;t be for too long. If a startup fails, it will probably fail quickly enough that you can return to academic life. And if it succeeds, you may find you no longer have such a burning desire to be an assistant professor.</p>

<p>If you want to do it, do it. Starting a startup is not the great mystery it seems from outside. It&#8217;s not something you have to know about &#8220;business&#8221; to do. Build something users love, and spend less than you make. How hard is that?</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>[1] Google&#8217;s revenues are about two billion a year, but half comes from ads on other sites.</p>

<p>[2] One advantage startups have over established companies is that there are no discrimination laws about starting businesses. For example, I would be reluctant to start a startup with a woman who had small children, or was likely to have them soon. But you&#8217;re not allowed to ask prospective employees if they plan to have kids soon. Believe it or not, under current US law, you&#8217;re not even allowed to discriminate on the basis of intelligence. Whereas when you&#8217;re starting a company, you can discriminate on any basis you want about who you start it with.</p>

<p>[3] Learning to hack is a lot cheaper than business school, because you can do it mostly on your own. For the price of a Linux box, a copy of K&amp;R, and a few hours of advice from your neighbor&#8217;s fifteen year old son, you&#8217;ll be well on your way.</p>

<p>[4] Corollary: Avoid starting a startup to sell things to the biggest company of all, the government. Yes, there are lots of opportunities to sell them technology. But let someone else start those startups.</p>

<p>[5] A friend who started a company in Germany told me they do care about the paperwork there, and that there&#8217;s more of it. Which helps explain why there are not more startups in Germany.</p>

<p>[6] At the seed stage our valuation was in principle $100,000, because Julian got 10% of the company. But this is a very misleading number, because the money was the least important of the things Julian gave us.</p>

<p>[7] The same goes for companies that seem to want to acquire you. There will be a few that are only pretending to in order to pick your brains. But you can never tell for sure which these are, so the best approach is to seem entirely open, but to fail to mention a few critical technical secrets.</p>

<p>[8] I was as bad an employee as this place was a company. I apologize to anyone who had to work with me there.</p>

<p>[9] You could probably write a book about how to succeed in business by doing everything in exactly the opposite way from the DMV.</p>

<p>哥白尼不认同托勒密的体系，一个极其重要的原因是，他觉得托勒密提出的偏心等距点(equant)毫无美感……</p>

<p>托马斯?库恩，《哥白尼革命》</p>

<p>我们所有人都受到凯利? 约翰逊①的影响，狂热地相信外观优美的飞机一定会飞得同样漂亮。</p>

<p>本?里奇，《臭鼬计划》</p>

<p>美感是第一道关卡。丑陋的数学在世界上无法生存。</p>

<p>G. H. 哈代，《一个数学家的自白》</p>

<p>最近，我与一个在 MIT 教书的朋友交谈。他的研究领域很热门，每年申请他的研究生的人多得让他应付不过来。“很多人看上去很聪明，”他说，“但是我不知道他们的品味如何。”</p>

<p>品味。如今很少听到这个词了，人们往往使用别的叫法，但它却的的确确是我们离不开的基本概念。我的朋友的意思是，他想要的学生不仅应该技术过硬，还应当能够使用技术做出优美的产品。</p>

<p>数学家会把出色的工作称赞为“优美的”。无论古今，科学家、工程师、音乐家、建筑师、设计师、作家、画家都是这样做的，他们都使用同一个词。这仅仅是巧合吗，还是他们之间有共识？如果真的有共识，那么我们能不能将某一个领域发现的“美”的规律运用于另一个领域呢？</p>

<p>对于我们设计师来说，美就不仅仅是一个理论问题了。如果世界上真有“美”存在，我们需要能够认出它。设计产品时，我们需要良好的品味。与其把“美”说成一个虚无缥缈的抽象概念，还不如让我们考虑一个实际的问题（这样就能避免喋喋不休的空谈）：如何才能做出优美的产品？</p>

<p>如果你在当今社会提到“品味”，很多人会对你说“品味是主观的”。他们真的就是这么认为的。喜欢一件东西，却不知道为什么自己喜欢它，原因可能是这件东西是美的，但也可能因为他们的母亲也拥有同样的东西，或者杂志上某个明星使用它，或者仅仅因为它的价格很昂贵。人类的思想就是没有经过整理的无数杂念的混合。</p>

<p>我们大多数人从孩提时代起就被鼓励不要去分析清楚自己的头脑。如果你的小弟弟画图时把人都涂成绿色，你想取笑他，你妈妈很可能会对你说：“你有你喜欢的方式，他有他喜欢的方式。”</p>

<p>你妈妈这时不是教给你什么是美学，而只是想阻止你们两个争吵。</p>

<p>就像大人哄小孩的其他话一样，这句话也是模棱两可的，与其他话会发生冲突。大人教导你说品味只是每个人的偏好而已。但是来到博物馆，他们却对你说，仔细观赏达?芬奇的作品，因为他是伟大的艺术家，品味超凡。</p>

<p>小孩子受到这样的教导会怎么想？他会怎么理解“伟大的艺术家”？这么多年来，别人无数遍地告诉他，品味就是一种偏好，是每个人自己的事情，所以他不可能直接就明白，所谓“伟大的艺术家”就是这个人的作品要比其他人的杰出。他更可能觉得，所谓“伟大的艺术家”只是针对我个人世界而言的，就是很符合我自己口味的艺术家，好比某本书上说食用西兰花对我的健康有利，所以我就应该喜欢吃西兰花一样。</p>

<p>把品味说成个人的偏好可以有效地杜绝争论，防止人们争执哪一种品味更好。但是问题是，这种说法是不正确的。只要你自己开始动手设计东西，就能明白这一点。</p>

<p>不管每个人的工作是什么，他们内心里都有一种愿望——把自己的工作做好。足球运动员想赢得比赛，CEO 想增加利润。做好自己的工作会真正令人感到自豪和愉快。但是，如果你是一个设计师，并且你不承认有一种人们共同认可的东西叫做“美”，那么你就没有办法做好工作。如果品味只是一种个人偏好，那么每个人都是完美无缺的：你喜欢自己看上的东西，那就足够了。</p>

<p>就像别的工作一样，只要你不断地从事设计工作，你就会做得越来越好。你的品味会出现变化，你会像别人一样有所提高。如果这样的话，那么你以前的品味就不只是与现在不同，而是不如现在的好。因此，所谓的“品味没有好坏之分”的公理也就顿时见鬼去了。</p>

<p>现在流行“相对主义”，即认为真理是相对的。即使你已经从小孩变成了成年人，这种观点依然可能妨碍你思考“品味”。但是，只要你走出狭隘的自我，至少在心里对自己说，确实存在比其他设计更好的杰出设计，那么你就能开始仔细研究了。你的品味是如何变化的？什么原因使你做出不好的设计？其他人对设计是什么观点？</p>

<p>只要你开始思考这些问题，你就会发现，众多不同学科对“美”的认识有着惊人的相似度。优秀设计的原则是许多学科的共同原则，一再反复地出现。</p>

<p>好的设计是简单的。从数学领域到绘画领域，你都可以听到这种说法。在数学中，它表示简短的证明往往是更好的证明。特别是对于数学公理来说，少即是多。在编程中，这种说法也基本适用。对于建筑师和设计者，它意味着美依赖于一些精心选择的结构性元素，而不依赖于表面装饰品的堆砌。（装饰品本身并不是坏事，只有当它被用来掩盖结构的苍白时，才变成了一件坏事。）绘画也是类似的，认真观察的、非常有代表性的静物作品往往要比表面极尽华美、但是实质上只是无意义重复的“巨作”（比如再现非常复杂的花边的绘画作品）更有价值。在写作上，这种说法意味着只说必须要说的话，并且说得简短。</p>

<p>这样强调简单似乎有点奇怪。有人会说，简单就是事物本来的样子，装饰反而意味着更多的工作。但是，当人们自己从事创造性工作的时候，好像就会忘了保持简单这个原则。刚开始写作的人喜欢用浮夸的语调，根本不像他们平时说话的样子。设计师喜欢用波浪式卷曲表现他们的艺术感。画家发现自己都是表现主义者(expressionist)。这些装饰都是花架子，在作家的长句、画家“表现主义”的画笔之下，根本就是空洞无物，表面的装饰掩盖了内部的空虚，太可怕了。</p>

<p>当你被迫把东西做得很简单时，你就被迫直接面对真正的问题。当你不能用表面的装饰交差时，你就不得不做好真正的本质部分。</p>

<p>好的设计永不过时。只要没有错误，每一个数学证明都是永不过时的。所以，数学家哈代才会说：“丑陋的数学在世界上无法生存。”他的意思与飞机设计师凯利? 约翰逊的观点是一样的：如果解决方法是丑陋的，那就肯定还有更好的解决方法，只是还没有发现而已。</p>

<p>以永不过时作为目标是一种帮助自己找到最佳答案的方法：如果你不愿别人的答案取代你的答案，你就只好自己做出最佳答案。某些大师的作品太过杰出，永不过时，使得后人几乎难以在该领域立足。自从16世纪出现了德国雕刻大师丢勒(Dürer)，后世的雕刻家都因为自己的作品被拿来与他的作品作比较而苦不堪言。</p>

<p>以永不过时作为目标也是一种避开时代风潮的影响的方法。“风潮”这个词，从字面上就可以看出，它就是一阵风似的，随着时间经常改变。如果一件东西长盛不衰，那么它的吸引力一定来自本身的魅力，而不是来自风潮的影响。</p>

<p>说来奇怪，如果你希望自己的作品对未来的人们有吸引力，方法之一就是让你的作品对上几代人有吸引力。我们很难猜想未来是什么样子，但是可以肯定，未来的人们不会在乎今天流行的风潮，这一点与上几代人是相同的。所以，如果你的作品对今天的人们以及1500年的人都有吸引力，那么它极有可能也会吸引2500年的人。</p>

<p>好的设计解决正确的问题。厨房的煤气灶有四个出火口，排成一个正方形。每个出火口都由一个调节器控制，四个出火口就有四个调节器。请问应该如何摆放调节器？最简单的摆放方法当然是把四个调节器排成一列，但这不解决问题。要是这样做，人们使用起来就很不方便，每次都要停下来想一下到底每个调节器对应的是哪个出火口。如果直接把调节器排成与出火口一样的正方形，就不会有这个问题了。</p>

<p>许多坏设计做得很辛苦，但是从一开始方向就错了。20世纪中期，有一股使用无衬线(sans-serif)字体的潮流。这一类字体接近于纯手写的样式，但是它无助于解决最主要的问题。印刷出来的文字首先应该是易于辨认的，所以能够清晰地分辨字母就是最主要的问题。传统的新罗马(Times Roman)字体是一种有衬线的字体，虽然看上去古老得就像维多利亚女王时代的风格，但是它的小写g就是可以很轻易地与小写y区分。</p>

<p>答案可以不断改进，同样，问题本身也可以不断改进。软件的难题通常可以被改成等价的较易解决的形式。历史上，物理学的主要难题曾经一度是如何诠释经典著作，后来逐渐变成对可观测到的行为进行预测，这种转变使得物理学的发展速度大大加快。</p>

<p>好的设计是有启发性的。英国女作家简? 奥斯汀的作品几乎不带有任何描述。她不告诉读者每件东西看上去是什么样子，只是把故事讲得非常生动，让读者自己把一切都想象出来。同样，绘画作品也分为描述性绘画和启发性绘画，后者往往比前者更引人入胜。每个人看到《蒙娜丽莎》都有自己的理解。</p>

<p>在建筑学和设计学中，这条原则意味着，一幢建筑或一个物品应该允许你按照自己的愿望来使用。举例来说，一幢好的建筑物应该可以充当平台，让你想怎么布置就可以怎么布置，过上自己想过的家庭生活，而不是使得你像执行程序一样只能过上建筑师为你安排的生活。</p>

<p>在软件业中，这条原则意味着，你应该为用户提供一些基本模块，使得他们可以随心所欲自由组合，就像玩乐高积木那样。在数学中，这条原则意味着，一个可以成为许多新工作基础的证明要优于一个难度很高、但无助于未来学科发展的证明。在科学领域中，总体上可以把引用次数看作对他人启发性大小的粗略指标。</p>

<p>好的设计通常有点滑稽。这条原则可能不是所有情况下都成立。但是，丢勒的雕刻、芬兰设计师沙里宁(Saarinen)的子宫椅(Womb Chair)、意大利罗马的万神殿(Pantheon)、最初的保时捷911型汽车（图9-1），在我看来都很有趣。逻辑学家哥德尔(G?del)的不完备定理就好像一个玩笑那样有意思。</p>

<p>图9-1　保时捷911E，1973年产</p>

<p>我想，这是因为幽默一定程度上反映了力量。幽默感是强壮的一种表现，始终拥有幽默感就代表你对厄运一笑了之，而丧失幽默感则表示你被厄运深深伤到。所以，强壮的标志（或者至少是特点）就是轻松面对自己的人生。充满自信的人常常像燕子一样，以一种居高临下的姿态轻盈地看待周围的一切，比如希区柯克拍摄的电影、16世纪画家布勒哲尔(Bruegel)的绘画（甚至莎士比亚也是一个这方面的例子）。</p>

<p>好的设计并非一定要滑稽，但是很难想象完全无趣的设计会是好的设计。</p>

<p>好的设计是艰苦的。如果观察那些做出伟大作品的人，你会发现他们的共同点就是工作得非常艰苦。如果你工作得不艰苦，你可能正在浪费时间。</p>

<p>困难的问题需要艰巨的付出才能解决，高难度的数学证明需要结构非常精细的解决方法（它们往往做起来很有趣），工程学也是如此。</p>

<p>当你攀登高山时，必须扔掉一切不必要的装备。在困难地点或预算不足的条件下，建筑师就只能做出很简练的设计。当解决难题成为压倒一切的任务时，那些流行样式与华丽装饰就被抛到一边去了。</p>

<p>并非所有的艰苦都是值得的。世界上有有益的痛苦，也有无益的痛苦。你需要的是咬牙向前冲刺的痛苦，而不是脚被钉子扎破的痛苦。解决难题的痛苦对设计师有好处，但是对付挑剔的客户的痛苦或者对付质量低劣的建材的痛苦就是另外一回事了。</p>

<p>在绘画上，肖像画通常占据最高地位。这不是偶然的，原因不仅是面部肖像比其他题材更能打动人，还因为我们太擅长观察脸，所以肖像画家不得不加倍努力才能达到我们的要求。如果画的是树，树枝画偏了五度也不会有人发现。但是，如果你把别人的眼睛画偏了五度，人们一眼就能看出来。</p>

<p>德国包豪斯(Bauhaus)学派的设计师采纳了美国建筑师路易斯? 沙利文(Louis Sullivan)的观点“功能决定形式”(form follows function)，但是他们实际上的理解是“功能应当决定形式”[1]。真实情况是，如果开发“功能”非常艰难，那么“形式”将不得不全部都由“功能”决定，因为没有多余的精力再来单独开发“形式”了。人们常常觉得野生动物非常优美，原因就是它们的生活非常艰苦，在外形上不可能有多余的部分了。</p>

<p>好的设计看起来轻松。优秀运动员比赛时，让人觉得他轻轻松松就获胜了，优秀设计师也是如此，他们的工作看上去很容易。大多数时候，这是一种错觉。作家的文章读起来流畅自如，但是背后其实经过了反复修改。</p>

<p>科学和工程学的一些最重大的发现在形式上往往很简单，会使得你觉得自己也想到过。可是，如果它真的那么简单，为什么发现人不是你呢？</p>

<p>达?芬奇的有些肖像画只是几根线条。看着它们，你会想只要把这十根八根线条放对位置，你也能画出如此优美的肖像画。说的没错，可是难就难在找出正确的位置。只要位置偏移一点点，整幅作品就会一溃千里。</p>

<p>白描其实是最难画的视觉媒介，因为它们要求几近完美的再现。用数学语言说，线条属于闭合解(closed-form solution)，水平不够的艺术家没有办法直接解决问题，只能通过不断逼近来求解。许多孩子在十岁左右放弃了绘画，原因之一就是这时他们开始学习成年人的绘画技法，首先练习用线条勾勒出人脸。</p>

<p>在大多数领域，看上去容易的事情，背后都需要大量的练习。练习的作用也许是训练你把刻意为之的事情变成一种自觉的行为。有时，我们的训练只是为了让身体养成下意识的反应。优秀钢琴家弹奏名曲可以不经过大脑直接完成，艺术家也是这样，熟练以后，脑海中的艺术形象会自动从手上流淌出来，仿佛有人在一旁为他打节奏一样。</p>

<p>人们有时会说自己有了“状态”，我的理解是，他们这时可以控制自己的脊髓。脊髓是更本能的反应，面对难题时，它能释放你的直觉。</p>

<p>好的设计会运用对称。对称也许只是简洁性的一种表现，但是它十分重要，值得单独列为一点。自然界的对称大量存在，这就说明了对称的重要性。</p>

<p>对称有两种：重复性对称和递归性对称。递归性对称就是指子元素的重复，比如树叶上叶脉的纹路。</p>

<p>历史上，对称曾经泛滥一时，导致现在它在某些领域已经不流行了。从维多利亚女王时代开始，建筑师就有意多建造不对称的建筑。20世纪20年代，不对称成了现代主义建筑的一个明确的前提条件。但是即使如此，这些建筑物往往也只是在主轴上不对称，细节部分依然大量使用对称。</p>

<p>在写作中，你会发现对称无处不在，短语、句子、小说的情节都是如此。音乐和美术也大量使用对称。拼接式的美术作品（还有塞尚的一部分作品）有非常强烈的视觉感染力，原因就是整幅作品由相同的作图元素构成，这也属于对称。对称性构图产生了一些最让人难忘的绘画作品，尤其是那些两个半边互相呼应的作品，比如米开朗基罗的壁画《创世纪》和格兰特?伍德的油画《美国式哥特》。</p>

<p>在数学和工程学中，递归尤其有用。归纳式证明方法既简洁又美妙。在软件中，能用递归解决的问题通常代表已经找到了最佳解法。巴黎的埃菲尔铁塔如此引人注目，部分原因就是它的外形是递归的，大塔上面还有小塔（图9-2）。</p>

<p>图9-2　埃菲尔铁塔，1889。大塔上面有小塔2</p>

<p>对称的危险在于它可以用来取代思考，在大量使用重复的时候这种危险性更大。</p>

<p>好的设计师法自然。我不是说模仿大自然这种行为本身有多么好，而是说大自然在长期的演化中已经解决了很多设计问题。所以，如果你的设计与大自然很接近，那么它基本上不会很差。</p>

<p>模仿不算作弊。如果一部小说写得好像真实生活的再现，没人会提出异议。虽然写实的价值常常被误解，但它也是绘画的一个重要工具。写实的目的不是为了给生活留下一模一样的记录，而是为你的思想提供一个咀嚼点：你的眼睛看着某样东西，你的手就代表你的思想，画出一些比较有意思的内容。</p>

<p>模仿大自然也是工程学的有效方法。长久以来，船只就像动物一样有龙骨和肋骨。不过，前提条件是技术水平要达到，只有这样才有可能模仿大自然。早期的飞机设计师按照鸟的形状设计飞机，这样做其实是错的，因为那时还没有足以模拟鸟类行为的轻型材料和能源，也做不出高度复杂的控制系统，所以飞机还不可能像鸟类那样飞②。但是，我能想象五十年后，小型的无人侦察飞机可以做得完全像鸟一样。</p>

<p>现在的计算机已经很强大了，不仅能模拟出大自然的环境，还能模拟大自然发展演变的结果。遗传算法可能会创造出正常条件下难以设计的复杂事物。</p>

<p>图9-3　达?芬奇，《一匹直立的马的研究》，1481—1499</p>

<p>好的设计就是再设计。很少有人一次就把事情做对。专家的做法是先完成一个早期原型，然后提出修改计划，最后把早期原型扔掉。</p>

<p>扔掉早期原型是需要信心的，你必须有本事看出什么地方还可以改进。举例来说，刚刚开始学画的人往往不愿意重画画错的地方。他们觉得能画成现在这样已经很不错了，如果重画某些部分，结果可能还不如现在。所以，他们就说服自己，我的画已经过得去了，没准别人也会这么看。</p>

<p>这想法很危险。你应该培养对自己的不满。达?芬奇为了把一根线画对，经常要画五六次。保时捷911型汽车的原型很粗糙，只有在重新设计后它的背部轮廓才变成现在这样独特的曲线。建筑师莱特设计的古根海姆博物馆，最早的时候，右半边有点像古代的塔庙(ziggurat)，他后来把它倒过来，就成了现在的样子。</p>

<p>犯错误是很正常的事情。你不要把犯错看成灾难，要勇于承认、勇于改正。达?芬奇实际上重新发明了素描这种艺术形式，把它当作一种探索更多可能的方式。开源软件因为公开承认自己会有bug，反而使得代码的bug比较少。</p>

<p>做修改的时候，有一个合适的工具会使得改动更容易。美术史上，15世纪油彩取代蛋彩(tempera)③就是一个重大突破，油彩使得画家更方便地处理那些困难的主题（比如人体），因为油彩可以调制，还可以重画，蛋彩就做不到这些。</p>

<p>好的设计允许复制。我们对待复制的态度经常是一个否定之否定的过程。刚入门的新手不知不觉地模仿他人，逐渐熟练之后才开始创作原创性作品。最后他会意识到，把事情做对比原创更重要。</p>

<p>不知不觉的模仿几乎必然将导致坏设计。如果你不知道自己的想法从何而来，那么你可能就是在模仿另一个模仿者。19世纪中期，拉斐尔画派主导了整个画坛，几乎每个学画的人都在模仿拉斐尔，可是经常谬以千里。有一些艺术家实在看不下去了，被如此之多模仿拉斐尔的人搞烦了，于是成立了前拉斐尔画派④。</p>

<p>等到你逐渐对一件事产生热情的时候，就不会满足于模仿了。你的品味就进入了第二阶段，开始自觉地进行原创。</p>

<p>我想，最伟大的大师最终会达到一种超脱自我的境界。他们一心想找到正确答案，如果别人已经回答出了一部分，那就没理由不拿来用。他们足够自信地使用他人的成果，完全不担心因此丧失个人的特点。</p>

<p>好的设计常常是奇特的。某些最出色的作品堪称不可思议：欧拉公式、16世纪画家布勒哲尔的《雪中猎人》（图9-4）、SR-71“黑鸟”超音速侦察机（图9-5）、计算机的 Lisp 语言等。它们不仅优美，而且美得很奇特。
图9-4　布勒哲尔的《雪中猎人》，1565年
图9-5　洛克希德公司的SR-71“黑鸟”超音速侦察机，1964年</p>

<p>我不太确定原因，可能是因为我不够聪明，才会觉得它们看上去很奇特。一条狗看到开罐器也会认为那是一个奇迹。如果我是天才的话，可能会觉得是再平常不过的事情，它又没有说错，有什么好奇怪的。</p>

<p>我在前文提到的好设计的大多数特点都是可以培育出来的，但是我觉得“奇特”这个特点是无法培育的。你最多就是在它开始显现时不要把它扼杀掉。爱因斯坦并不想让相对论变得很奇特，他只想找出真理，是真理本身显得很奇特。</p>

<p>我曾在一家美术学校学习绘画，那里的学生最想做的就是发展出一种自己的风格。但是，如果你想做出好作品，不可避免地会采用一种独特的方式，就好像每个人走路的姿势其实都不尽相同。米开朗基罗并没想过要树立米开朗基罗风格，他只是想画好作品，结果不由自主地创造出了米开朗基罗风格。</p>

<p>你最后发展出来的风格是自然而然形成的。“奇特”这个特点尤其如此，没有其他路可走。它就像连接大西洋和太平洋的“西北航道”，无数人希望找到这条捷径。16世纪的风格主义者、19世纪的浪漫主义者、一代代的美国高中生都在寻找，但就是找不到。唯一达到“奇特”的方法，就是追求做出好作品，完成之后再回过头看。</p>

<p>好的设计会成批出现。15世纪住在佛罗伦萨的伟大艺术家有建筑师布鲁内莱斯基、画家吉贝尔蒂、雕塑家多纳泰洛、画家马萨乔、画家菲利普里皮、画家弗拉安吉利科、雕塑家韦罗基奥、画家波提切利、达?芬奇和米开朗基罗。当时，米兰也是同等的大城市，请问你能说出15世纪米兰城有什么伟大艺术家吗？</p>

<p>15世纪的佛罗伦萨有一些独特的条件，它们是不可延续的，因为今天的佛罗伦萨已经不是如此了。我们还必须假设达?芬奇和米开朗基罗拥有的天赋，在米兰城里一定也有人拥有。那么为什么没有出现米兰的达?芬奇呢？</p>

<p>今天，生活在美国的人口大概是15世纪佛罗伦萨的一千倍。那么按照比例推算，在我们之中存在着一千个达?芬奇和一千个米开朗基罗。如果这种推算成立，我们应该每天都看到令人惊叹的艺术奇迹。但是，事实并非如此，原因就是达?芬奇的出现除了他本身的天赋以外，还有赖于1450年的佛罗伦萨。</p>

<p>推动人才成批涌现的最大因素就是，让有天赋的人聚在一起，共同解决某个难题。互相激励比天赋更重要，达?芬奇之所以成为达?芬奇，主要原因不仅仅是他的天赋，更重要的是他生活在当时的佛罗伦萨，而不是米兰。今天，人类生活的流动性高得多，但是伟大的项目依然不成比例地集中在少数几个热点上：德国包豪斯建筑学院、曼哈顿计划、《纽约客》杂志、洛克希德公司的臭鼬工作室、施乐公司的帕洛阿尔托研究中心。</p>

<p>在历史的任何时刻都有一些热点项目，一些团体在这些项目上做出伟大的成绩。如果你远离这些中心，几乎不可能单靠自己就取得伟大成果。某种程度上，你个人最多可以对趋势产生一定的影响，但是你不可能决定趋势，实际上是趋势决定了你。（或许有人办得到，但是米兰的达?芬奇显然没有办到。）</p>

<p>好的设计常常是大胆的。在任何一段历史中，人们都会把某些荒谬的东西当作正确的，并且深信不疑，以至于一旦你出言质疑，就有被排挤或者被暴力伤害的危险。</p>

<p>我们自己的这个时代要是不同以往，当然令人欢欣鼓舞。但是就我所知，它并没有任何不同。</p>

<p>这个问题不仅存在于每个年代，还或多或少存在于每个领域。许多文艺复兴时期的艺术作品在当时都被认为极其大逆不道。根据意大利画家瓦萨里的记载, 波提切利因此向教会忏悔并且放弃绘画，巴尔托洛梅奥和洛伦索迪克雷迪则是把自己的作品烧掉。爱因斯坦的相对论触犯了许多同时代的物理学家，许多年后还没有被完全接受，法国物理学家直到20世纪50年代才接受相对论[2]。</p>

<p>今天的实验性错误就是明天的新理论。如果你想做出伟大的新成果，那就不能对常识与真理不相吻合之处视而不见，反而应该特别注意才对。</p>

<p>实际上，我觉得发现丑陋的东西要比你想象出一个优美的东西更容易。大多数做出优美成果的人好像只是为了修正他们眼中丑陋的东西。伟大成果的出现常常来源于某人看到一样东西后，心想我能做得比这更好。拜占庭帝国的《圣母像》最早是根据某个公认的模板画的，非常机械呆板。几百年后的14世纪，意大利画家乔托看到以后，深感不满，决定动手改进，他因此成为文艺复兴的先行者。哥白尼对地心说无法解释的事情深感困扰，他的同时代人都觉得这可以忍受，他却认为一定能找到一种更好的解释。</p>

<p>单单是无法容忍丑陋的东西还不够，只有对这个领域非常熟悉，你才可能发现哪些地方可以动手改进。你必须锻炼自己。只有在成为某个领域的专家之后，你才会听到心里有一个细微的声音说：“这样解决太糟糕了！一定有更好的选择。”不要忽视这种声音，要培育它们。优秀作品的秘诀就是：非常严格的品味，再加上实现这种品味的能力。

Taste For Makers</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Copernicus&#8217; aesthetic objections to [equants] provided one essential motive for his rejection of the Ptolemaic system&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All of us had been trained by Kelly Johnson and believed fanatically in his insistence that an airplane that looked beautiful would fly the same way.&#8221;</p>

</ul>


<p>&#8220;Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>G. H. Hardy, A Mathematician&#8217;s Apology</li>
</ul>


<p>I was talking recently to a friend who teaches at MIT. His field is hot now and every year he is inundated by applications from would-be graduate students. &#8220;A lot of them seem smart,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What I can&#8217;t tell is whether they have any kind of taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taste. You don&#8217;t hear that word much now. And yet we still need the underlying concept, whatever we call it. What my friend meant was that he wanted students who were not just good technicians, but who could use their technical knowledge to design beautiful things.</p>

<p>Mathematicians call good work &#8220;beautiful,&#8221; and so, either now or in the past, have scientists, engineers, musicians, architects, designers, writers, and painters. Is it just a coincidence that they used the same word, or is there some overlap in what they meant? If there is an overlap, can we use one field&#8217;s discoveries about beauty to help us in another?</p>

<p>For those of us who design things, these are not just theoretical questions. If there is such a thing as beauty, we need to be able to recognize it. We need good taste to make good things. Instead of treating beauty as an airy abstraction, to be either blathered about or avoided depending on how one feels about airy abstractions, let&#8217;s try considering it as a practical question: how do you make good stuff?</p>

<p>If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tell you that &#8220;taste is subjective.&#8221; They believe this because it really feels that way to them. When they like something, they have no idea why. It could be because it&#8217;s beautiful, or because their mother had one, or because they saw a movie star with one in a magazine, or because they know it&#8217;s expensive. Their thoughts are a tangle of unexamined impulses.</p>

<p>Most of us are encouraged, as children, to leave this tangle unexamined. If you make fun of your little brother for coloring people green in his coloring book, your mother is likely to tell you something like &#8220;you like to do it your way and he likes to do it his way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Your mother at this point is not trying to teach you important truths about aesthetics. She&#8217;s trying to get the two of you to stop bickering.</p>

<p>Like many of the half-truths adults tell us, this one contradicts other things they tell us. After dinning into you that taste is merely a matter of personal preference, they take you to the museum and tell you that you should pay attention because Leonardo is a great artist.</p>

<p>What goes through the kid&#8217;s head at this point? What does he think &#8220;great artist&#8221; means? After having been told for years that everyone just likes to do things their own way, he is unlikely to head straight for the conclusion that a great artist is someone whose work is better than the others&#8217;. A far more likely theory, in his Ptolemaic model of the universe, is that a great artist is something that&#8217;s good for you, like broccoli, because someone said so in a book.</p>

<p>Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good way to prevent disputes. The trouble is, it&#8217;s not true. You feel this when you start to design things.</p>

<p>Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do better. Football players like to win games. CEOs like to increase earnings. It&#8217;s a matter of pride, and a real pleasure, to get better at your job. But if your job is to design things, and there is no such thing as beauty, then there is no way to get better at your job. If taste is just personal preference, then everyone&#8217;s is already perfect: you like whatever you like, and that&#8217;s it.</p>

<p>As in any job, as you continue to design things, you&#8217;ll get better at it. Your tastes will change. And, like anyone who gets better at their job, you&#8217;ll know you&#8217;re getting better. If so, your old tastes were not merely different, but worse. Poof goes the axiom that taste can&#8217;t be wrong.</p>

<p>Relativism is fashionable at the moment, and that may hamper you from thinking about taste, even as yours grows. But if you come out of the closet and admit, at least to yourself, that there is such a thing as good and bad design, then you can start to study good design in detail. How has your taste changed? When you made mistakes, what caused you to make them? What have other people learned about design?</p>

<p>Once you start to examine the question, it&#8217;s surprising how much different fields&#8217; ideas of beauty have in common. The same principles of good design crop up again and again.</p>

<p>Good design is simple. You hear this from math to painting. In math it means that a shorter proof tends to be a better one. Where axioms are concerned, especially, less is more. It means much the same thing in programming. For architects and designers it means that beauty should depend on a few carefully chosen structural elements rather than a profusion of superficial ornament. (Ornament is not in itself bad, only when it&#8217;s camouflage on insipid form.) Similarly, in painting, a still life of a few carefully observed and solidly modelled objects will tend to be more interesting than a stretch of flashy but mindlessly repetitive painting of, say, a lace collar. In writing it means: say what you mean and say it briefly.</p>

<p>It seems strange to have to emphasize simplicity. You&#8217;d think simple would be the default. Ornate is more work. But something seems to come over people when they try to be creative. Beginning writers adopt a pompous tone that doesn&#8217;t sound anything like the way they speak. Designers trying to be artistic resort to swooshes and curlicues. Painters discover that they&#8217;re expressionists. It&#8217;s all evasion. Underneath the long words or the &#8220;expressive&#8221; brush strokes, there is not much going on, and that&#8217;s frightening.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re forced to be simple, you&#8217;re forced to face the real problem. When you can&#8217;t deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.</p>

<p>Good design is timeless. In math, every proof is timeless unless it contains a mistake. So what does Hardy mean when he says there is no permanent place for ugly mathematics? He means the same thing Kelly Johnson did: if something is ugly, it can&#8217;t be the best solution. There must be a better one, and eventually someone will discover it.</p>

<p>Aiming at timelessness is a way to make yourself find the best answer: if you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself. Some of the greatest masters did this so well that they left little room for those who came after. Every engraver since Durer has had to live in his shadow.</p>

<p>Aiming at timelessness is also a way to evade the grip of fashion. Fashions almost by definition change with time, so if you can make something that will still look good far into the future, then its appeal must derive more from merit and less from fashion.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, if you want to make something that will appeal to future generations, one way to do it is to try to appeal to past generations. It&#8217;s hard to guess what the future will be like, but we can be sure it will be like the past in caring nothing for present fashions. So if you can make something that appeals to people today and would also have appealed to people in 1500, there is a good chance it will appeal to people in 2500.</p>

<p>Good design solves the right problem. The typical stove has four burners arranged in a square, and a dial to control each. How do you arrange the dials? The simplest answer is to put them in a row. But this is a simple answer to the wrong question. The dials are for humans to use, and if you put them in a row, the unlucky human will have to stop and think each time about which dial matches which burner. Better to arrange the dials in a square like the burners.</p>

<p>A lot of bad design is industrious, but misguided. In the mid twentieth century there was a vogue for setting text in sans-serif fonts. These fonts are closer to the pure, underlying letterforms. But in text that&#8217;s not the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve. For legibility it&#8217;s more important that letters be easy to tell apart. It may look Victorian, but a Times Roman lowercase g is easy to tell from a lowercase y.</p>

<p>Problems can be improved as well as solutions. In software, an intractable problem can usually be replaced by an equivalent one that&#8217;s easy to solve. Physics progressed faster as the problem became predicting observable behavior, instead of reconciling it with scripture.</p>

<p>Good design is suggestive. Jane Austen&#8217;s novels contain almost no description; instead of telling you how everything looks, she tells her story so well that you envision the scene for yourself. Likewise, a painting that suggests is usually more engaging than one that tells. Everyone makes up their own story about the Mona Lisa.</p>

<p>In architecture and design, this principle means that a building or object should let you use it how you want: a good building, for example, will serve as a backdrop for whatever life people want to lead in it, instead of making them live as if they were executing a program written by the architect.</p>

<p>In software, it means you should give users a few basic elements that they can combine as they wish, like Lego. In math it means a proof that becomes the basis for a lot of new work is preferable to a proof that was difficult, but doesn&#8217;t lead to future discoveries; in the sciences generally, citation is considered a rough indicator of merit.</p>

<p>Good design is often slightly funny. This one may not always be true. But Durer&#8217;s engravings and Saarinen&#8217;s womb chair and the Pantheon and the original Porsche 911 all seem to me slightly funny. Godel&#8217;s incompleteness theorem seems like a practical joke.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s because humor is related to strength. To have a sense of humor is to be strong: to keep one&#8217;s sense of humor is to shrug off misfortunes, and to lose one&#8217;s sense of humor is to be wounded by them. And so the mark&#8211; or at least the prerogative&#8211; of strength is not to take oneself too seriously. The confident will often, like swallows, seem to be making fun of the whole process slightly, as Hitchcock does in his films or Bruegel in his paintings&#8211; or Shakespeare, for that matter.</p>

<p>Good design may not have to be funny, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine something that could be called humorless also being good design.</p>

<p>Good design is hard. If you look at the people who&#8217;ve done great work, one thing they all seem to have in common is that they worked very hard. If you&#8217;re not working hard, you&#8217;re probably wasting your time.</p>

<p>Hard problems call for great efforts. In math, difficult proofs require ingenious solutions, and those tend to be interesting. Ditto in engineering.</p>

<p>When you have to climb a mountain you toss everything unnecessary out of your pack. And so an architect who has to build on a difficult site, or a small budget, will find that he is forced to produce an elegant design. Fashions and flourishes get knocked aside by the difficult business of solving the problem at all.</p>

<p>Not every kind of hard is good. There is good pain and bad pain. You want the kind of pain you get from going running, not the kind you get from stepping on a nail. A difficult problem could be good for a designer, but a fickle client or unreliable materials would not be.</p>

<p>In art, the highest place has traditionally been given to paintings of people. There is something to this tradition, and not just because pictures of faces get to press buttons in our brains that other pictures don&#8217;t. We are so good at looking at faces that we force anyone who draws them to work hard to satisfy us. If you draw a tree and you change the angle of a branch five degrees, no one will know. When you change the angle of someone&#8217;s eye five degrees, people notice.</p>

<p>When Bauhaus designers adopted Sullivan&#8217;s &#8220;form follows function,&#8221; what they meant was, form should follow function. And if function is hard enough, form is forced to follow it, because there is no effort to spare for error. Wild animals are beautiful because they have hard lives.</p>

<p>Good design looks easy. Like great athletes, great designers make it look easy. Mostly this is an illusion. The easy, conversational tone of good writing comes only on the eighth rewrite.</p>

<p>In science and engineering, some of the greatest discoveries seem so simple that you say to yourself, I could have thought of that. The discoverer is entitled to reply, why didn&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>Some Leonardo heads are just a few lines. You look at them and you think, all you have to do is get eight or ten lines in the right place and you&#8217;ve made this beautiful portrait. Well, yes, but you have to get them in exactly the right place. The slightest error will make the whole thing collapse.</p>

<p>Line drawings are in fact the most difficult visual medium, because they demand near perfection. In math terms, they are a closed-form solution; lesser artists literally solve the same problems by successive approximation. One of the reasons kids give up drawing at ten or so is that they decide to start drawing like grownups, and one of the first things they try is a line drawing of a face. Smack!</p>

<p>In most fields the appearance of ease seems to come with practice. Perhaps what practice does is train your unconscious mind to handle tasks that used to require conscious thought. In some cases you literally train your body. An expert pianist can play notes faster than the brain can send signals to his hand. Likewise an artist, after a while, can make visual perception flow in through his eye and out through his hand as automatically as someone tapping his foot to a beat.</p>

<p>When people talk about being in &#8220;the zone,&#8221; I think what they mean is that the spinal cord has the situation under control. Your spinal cord is less hesitant, and it frees conscious thought for the hard problems.</p>

<p>Good design uses symmetry. I think symmetry may just be one way to achieve simplicity, but it&#8217;s important enough to be mentioned on its own. Nature uses it a lot, which is a good sign.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of symmetry, repetition and recursion. Recursion means repetition in subelements, like the pattern of veins in a leaf.</p>

<p>Symmetry is unfashionable in some fields now, in reaction to excesses in the past. Architects started consciously making buildings asymmetric in Victorian times and by the 1920s asymmetry was an explicit premise of modernist architecture. Even these buildings only tended to be asymmetric about major axes, though; there were hundreds of minor symmetries.</p>

<p>In writing you find symmetry at every level, from the phrases in a sentence to the plot of a novel. You find the same in music and art. Mosaics (and some Cezannes) get extra visual punch by making the whole picture out of the same atoms. Compositional symmetry yields some of the most memorable paintings, especially when two halves react to one another, as in the Creation of Adam or American Gothic.</p>

<p>In math and engineering, recursion, especially, is a big win. Inductive proofs are wonderfully short. In software, a problem that can be solved by recursion is nearly always best solved that way. The Eiffel Tower looks striking partly because it is a recursive solution, a tower on a tower.</p>

<p>The danger of symmetry, and repetition especially, is that it can be used as a substitute for thought.</p>

<p>Good design resembles nature. It&#8217;s not so much that resembling nature is intrinsically good as that nature has had a long time to work on the problem. It&#8217;s a good sign when your answer resembles nature&#8217;s.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not cheating to copy. Few would deny that a story should be like life. Working from life is a valuable tool in painting too, though its role has often been misunderstood. The aim is not simply to make a record. The point of painting from life is that it gives your mind something to chew on: when your eyes are looking at something, your hand will do more interesting work.</p>

<p>Imitating nature also works in engineering. Boats have long had spines and ribs like an animal&#8217;s ribcage. In some cases we may have to wait for better technology: early aircraft designers were mistaken to design aircraft that looked like birds, because they didn&#8217;t have materials or power sources light enough (the Wrights&#8217; engine weighed 152 lbs. and generated only 12 hp.) or control systems sophisticated enough for machines that flew like birds, but I could imagine little unmanned reconnaissance planes flying like birds in fifty years.</p>

<p>Now that we have enough computer power, we can imitate nature&#8217;s method as well as its results. Genetic algorithms may let us create things too complex to design in the ordinary sense.</p>

<p>Good design is redesign. It&#8217;s rare to get things right the first time. Experts expect to throw away some early work. They plan for plans to change.</p>

<p>It takes confidence to throw work away. You have to be able to think, there&#8217;s more where that came from. When people first start drawing, for example, they&#8217;re often reluctant to redo parts that aren&#8217;t right; they feel they&#8217;ve been lucky to get that far, and if they try to redo something, it will turn out worse. Instead they convince themselves that the drawing is not that bad, really&#8211; in fact, maybe they meant it to look that way.</p>

<p>Dangerous territory, that; if anything you should cultivate dissatisfaction. In Leonardo&#8217;s drawings there are often five or six attempts to get a line right. The distinctive back of the Porsche 911 only appeared in the redesign of an awkward prototype. In Wright&#8217;s early plans for the Guggenheim, the right half was a ziggurat; he inverted it to get the present shape.</p>

<p>Mistakes are natural. Instead of treating them as disasters, make them easy to acknowledge and easy to fix. Leonardo more or less invented the sketch, as a way to make drawing bear a greater weight of exploration. Open-source software has fewer bugs because it admits the possibility of bugs.</p>

<p>It helps to have a medium that makes change easy. When oil paint replaced tempera in the fifteenth century, it helped painters to deal with difficult subjects like the human figure because, unlike tempera, oil can be blended and overpainted.</p>

<p>Good design can copy. Attitudes to copying often make a round trip. A novice imitates without knowing it; next he tries consciously to be original; finally, he decides it&#8217;s more important to be right than original.</p>

<p>Unknowing imitation is almost a recipe for bad design. If you don&#8217;t know where your ideas are coming from, you&#8217;re probably imitating an imitator. Raphael so pervaded mid-nineteenth century taste that almost anyone who tried to draw was imitating him, often at several removes. It was this, more than Raphael&#8217;s own work, that bothered the Pre-Raphaelites.</p>

<p>The ambitious are not content to imitate. The second phase in the growth of taste is a conscious attempt at originality.</p>

<p>I think the greatest masters go on to achieve a kind of selflessness. They just want to get the right answer, and if part of the right answer has already been discovered by someone else, that&#8217;s no reason not to use it. They&#8217;re confident enough to take from anyone without feeling that their own vision will be lost in the process.</p>

<p>Good design is often strange. Some of the very best work has an uncanny quality: Euler&#8217;s Formula, Bruegel&#8217;s Hunters in the Snow, the SR-71, Lisp. They&#8217;re not just beautiful, but strangely beautiful.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure why. It may just be my own stupidity. A can-opener must seem miraculous to a dog. Maybe if I were smart enough it would seem the most natural thing in the world that ei*pi = -1. It is after all necessarily true.</p>

<p>Most of the qualities I&#8217;ve mentioned are things that can be cultivated, but I don&#8217;t think it works to cultivate strangeness. The best you can do is not squash it if it starts to appear. Einstein didn&#8217;t try to make relativity strange. He tried to make it true, and the truth turned out to be strange.</p>

<p>At an art school where I once studied, the students wanted most of all to develop a personal style. But if you just try to make good things, you&#8217;ll inevitably do it in a distinctive way, just as each person walks in a distinctive way. Michelangelo was not trying to paint like Michelangelo. He was just trying to paint well; he couldn&#8217;t help painting like Michelangelo.</p>

<p>The only style worth having is the one you can&#8217;t help. And this is especially true for strangeness. There is no shortcut to it. The Northwest Passage that the Mannerists, the Romantics, and two generations of American high school students have searched for does not seem to exist. The only way to get there is to go through good and come out the other side.</p>

<p>Good design happens in chunks. The inhabitants of fifteenth century Florence included Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Fra Angelico, Verrocchio, Botticelli, Leonardo, and Michelangelo. Milan at the time was as big as Florence. How many fifteenth century Milanese artists can you name?</p>

<p>Something was happening in Florence in the fifteenth century. And it can&#8217;t have been heredity, because it isn&#8217;t happening now. You have to assume that whatever inborn ability Leonardo and Michelangelo had, there were people born in Milan with just as much. What happened to the Milanese Leonardo?</p>

<p>There are roughly a thousand times as many people alive in the US right now as lived in Florence during the fifteenth century. A thousand Leonardos and a thousand Michelangelos walk among us. If DNA ruled, we should be greeted daily by artistic marvels. We aren&#8217;t, and the reason is that to make Leonardo you need more than his innate ability. You also need Florence in 1450.</p>

<p>Nothing is more powerful than a community of talented people working on related problems. Genes count for little by comparison: being a genetic Leonardo was not enough to compensate for having been born near Milan instead of Florence. Today we move around more, but great work still comes disproportionately from a few hotspots: the Bauhaus, the Manhattan Project, the New Yorker, Lockheed&#8217;s Skunk Works, Xerox Parc.</p>

<p>At any given time there are a few hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them, and it&#8217;s nearly impossible to do good work yourself if you&#8217;re too far removed from one of these centers. You can push or pull these trends to some extent, but you can&#8217;t break away from them. (Maybe you can, but the Milanese Leonardo couldn&#8217;t.)</p>

<p>Good design is often daring. At every period of history, people have believed things that were just ridiculous, and believed them so strongly that you risked ostracism or even violence by saying otherwise.</p>

<p>If our own time were any different, that would be remarkable. As far as I can tell it isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>This problem afflicts not just every era, but in some degree every field. Much Renaissance art was in its time considered shockingly secular: according to Vasari, Botticelli repented and gave up painting, and Fra Bartolommeo and Lorenzo di Credi actually burned some of their work. Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity offended many contemporary physicists, and was not fully accepted for decades&#8211; in France, not until the 1950s.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s experimental error is tomorrow&#8217;s new theory. If you want to discover great new things, then instead of turning a blind eye to the places where conventional wisdom and truth don&#8217;t quite meet, you should pay particular attention to them.</p>

<p>As a practical matter, I think it&#8217;s easier to see ugliness than to imagine beauty. Most of the people who&#8217;ve made beautiful things seem to have done it by fixing something that they thought ugly. Great work usually seems to happen because someone sees something and thinks, I could do better than that. Giotto saw traditional Byzantine madonnas painted according to a formula that had satisfied everyone for centuries, and to him they looked wooden and unnatural. Copernicus was so troubled by a hack that all his contemporaries could tolerate that he felt there must be a better solution.</p>

<p>Intolerance for ugliness is not in itself enough. You have to understand a field well before you develop a good nose for what needs fixing. You have to do your homework. But as you become expert in a field, you&#8217;ll start to hear little voices saying, What a hack! There must be a better way. Don&#8217;t ignore those voices. Cultivate them. The recipe for great work is: very exacting taste, plus the ability to gratify it.</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>Sullivan actually said &#8220;form ever follows function,&#8221; but I think the usual misquotation is closer to what modernist architects meant.</p>

<p>March 2012</p>

<p>我不是一个很好的演讲者。我经常“嗯”个不停。有时我没了思路, 不得不暂停。我希望我是一个好的演讲者。我也希望我是一个好的写作者, 但我不希望我是同样好的演讲者。我真正想要的是好的想法，这在写作中占的比重比在演讲中占的比重大。</p>

<p>如果要写好，就要有好想法。如果你知道你在说什么，你可以用最平常的话说出来，别人会认为你不错。但是，在演讲中，往往背道而驰：好的想法，只占演讲的一小部分，惊人的小。</p>

<p>我第一次意识到这一点，是几年前的一个会议上。当时另外一位演讲者比我好很多。他让我们所有人都开怀大笑。比较下来，我似乎很尴尬，僵硬。后来我把我的演讲内容放到网上，就像我平常做的那样。在我做这件事的时候，我试图回想那个人的谈话内容是什么样的，突然我意识到他并没有说什么具体内容。</p>

<p>对于知道如何演讲的人来说，也许这已经是很明显的了；但它给我一个提醒，想法在演讲中占的比重比在写作中占的比重小很多。 [1]</p>

<p>几年后，我听到一个人的一段话，他不止是一个比我好的演讲者，更是一个有名的演讲者。他非常棒。所以我决定密切关注他，了解他是怎样做到的。大约十句之后，我发现自己在想：“我不希望是一个好的演讲者。”</p>

<p>成为一个真正的好演讲者与好主意不仅仅是只有正交相似性，很多时候两者背道而驰。例如，当我要演讲时，我通常会先写出来。我知道这是一个错误，我知道进行事先写好的演讲，使得更难与听众交互。获得听众注意力的方式是，要把你所有的注意力都放在他们身上，当你进行事先写好的演讲时，你的注意力就被观众和演讲稿分散了，即使你记住了内容。如果你想与观众交互，最好是除了演讲内容的大纲和即兴的一些句子之外，不要有任何其它东西。但是，如果你这样做，你就没有更多时间思考你要说的每一句话。 现场演讲时，偶尔会有新想法；但一般来说，这不会像写作一样，产生好想法，那时你可以在每一句话上花费任意的时间。</p>

<p>如果你充分排练了一次预先写好的演讲，你就可以渐渐找到即兴演讲的感觉了。演员就是这样。但在流畅与想法之间有一个折中。练习演讲所用的时间，可以用来使演讲更好。演员不会面临这样的诱惑，除非在极少数情况下，他们自己写剧本，但演讲者要自己写剧本。演讲之前我会在一个角落里拿着打印纸，尝试在头脑中排练。但大部分的时间我都在重新写。所有我的讲稿，最终都会布满删除线，或被重写。这当然会让我经常停顿，因为我还没有任何时间来练习刚改的东西。</p>

<p>根据观众的不同，有时候会出现更糟糕的折中。观众喜欢被奉承，喜欢笑话; 他们喜欢激动人心的演讲词汇。当你降低了观众的智商时，好的演讲者就是好的忽悠者。写作中也会有这个问题，但是要比演讲更严重。一名观众要比一位读者要笨。随性演讲者只能花一点点时间来思考所说的话，观众也只有一点点时间来思考他听到的话。观众很容易被周围人的反应所影响，在人和人之间的这种传播很凶猛，就好像低音要比高音更易穿墙一样。每一位观众，都是早期的暴徒，一个好的演讲者利用了这点。那场会议中，那个演讲者的演讲也让我笑了，部分原因是别人都笑了。</p>

<p>所以说演讲没用么？作为思想的来源，肯定逊色于文字的。但是，演讲不是仅仅带来思想。我去听演讲是因为我对演讲者感兴趣。对于类似于总统这样的人，听演讲是接近这些人的最近的交流方式，他没有时间和每个想见他的人单独见面。</p>

<p>演讲也是激励我做事情的方式。所以这么多著名的演讲者都是励志演讲者。这可能是公众演讲的真谛。这也许是最初的目的。听演讲引发的情绪反应是一股强有力的力量。我希望我可以说，那种力量对于疾病也是有好处的，但是我不确。</p>

<p>=================================</p>

<p>Writing and Speaking</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a very good speaker. I say &#8220;um&#8221; a lot. Sometimes I have to pause when I lose my train of thought. I wish I were a better speaker. But I don&#8217;t wish I were a better speaker like I wish I were a better writer. What I really want is to have good ideas, and that&#8217;s a much bigger part of being a good writer than being a good speaker.</p>

<p>Having good ideas is most of writing well. If you know what you&#8217;re talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you&#8217;ll be perceived as having a good style. With speaking it&#8217;s the opposite: having good ideas is an alarmingly small component of being a good speaker.</p>

<p>I first noticed this at a conference several years ago. There was another speaker who was much better than me. He had all of us roaring with laughter. I seemed awkward and halting by comparison. Afterward I put my talk online like I usually do. As I was doing it I tried to imagine what a transcript of the other guy&#8217;s talk would be like, and it was only then I realized he hadn&#8217;t said very much.</p>

<p>Maybe this would have been obvious to someone who knew more about speaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less ideas mattered in speaking than writing. [1]</p>

<p>A few years later I heard a talk by someone who was not merely a better speaker than me, but a famous speaker. Boy was he good. So I decided I&#8217;d pay close attention to what he said, to learn how he did it. After about ten sentences I found myself thinking &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a good speaker.&#8221;</p>

<p>Being a really good speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas, but in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction. For example, when I give a talk I usually write it out beforehand. I know that&#8217;s a mistake; I know delivering a prewritten talk makes it harder to engage with an audience. The way to get the attention of an audience is to give them your full attention, and when you&#8217;re delivering a prewritten talk your attention is always divided between the audience and the talk—even if you&#8217;ve memorized it. If you want to engage an audience it&#8217;s better to start with no more than an outline of what you want to say and ad lib the individual sentences. But if you do that you could spend no more time thinking about each sentence than it takes to say it. [2] Occasionally the stimulation of talking to a live audience makes you think of new things, but in general this is not going to generate ideas as well as writing does, where you can spend as long on each sentence as you want.</p>

<p>If you rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you can get asymptotically close to the sort of engagement you get when speaking ad lib. Actors do. But here again there&#8217;s a tradeoff between smoothness and ideas. All the time you spend practicing a talk, you could instead spend making it better. Actors don&#8217;t face that temptation except in the rare cases where they&#8217;ve written the script, but any speaker does. Before I give a talk I can usually be found sitting in a corner somewhere with a copy printed out on paper, trying to rehearse it in my head. But I always end up spending most of the time rewriting it instead. Every talk I give ends up being given from a manuscript full of things crossed out and rewritten. Which of course makes me um even more, because I haven&#8217;t had any time at all to practice the new bits. [3]</p>

<p>Depending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs than these. Audiences like to be flattered; they like jokes; they like to be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words. As you decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter. That&#8217;s true in writing too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks. Any given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader. Just as a speaker ad libbing can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to say it, a person hearing a talk can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to hear it. Plus people in an audience are always affected by the reactions of those around them, and the reactions that spread from person to person in an audience are disproportionately the more brutish sort, just as low notes travel through walls better than high ones. Every audience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that. Part of the reason I laughed so much at the talk by the good speaker at that conference was that everyone else did. [4]</p>

<p>So are talks useless? They&#8217;re certainly inferior to the written word as a source of ideas. But that&#8217;s not all talks are good for. When I go to a talk, it&#8217;s usually because I&#8217;m interested in the speaker. Listening to a talk is the closest most of us can get to having a conversation with someone like the president, who doesn&#8217;t have time to meet individually with all the people who want to meet him.</p>

<p>Talks are also good at motivating me to do things. It&#8217;s probably no coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as motivational speakers. That may be what public speaking is really for. It&#8217;s probably what it was originally for. The emotional reactions you can elicit with a talk can be a powerful force. I wish I could say that force was more often used for good than ill, but I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>[1] I&#8217;m not talking here about academic talks, which are a different type of thing. While the audience at an academic talk might appreciate a joke, they will (or at least should) make a conscious effort to see what new ideas you&#8217;re presenting.</p>

<p>[2] That&#8217;s the lower bound. In practice you can often do better, because talks are usually about things you&#8217;ve written or talked about before, and when you ad lib you end up reproducing some of those sentences. Like early medieval architecture, impromptu talks are made of spolia. Which feels a bit dishonest, incidentally, because you have to deliver these sentences as if you&#8217;d just thought of them.</p>

<p>[3] Robert Morris points out that there is a way in which practicing talks makes them better: reading a talk out loud can expose awkward parts. I agree and in fact I read most things I write out loud at least once for that reason.</p>

<p>[4] For sufficiently small audiences, it may not be true that being part of an audience makes people dumber. The real decline seems to set in when the audience gets too big for the talk to feel like a conversation—maybe around 10 people.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sam Altman and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.</p>

<p>1993
（本文来自On Lisp的前言）</p>

<p>这是一个永恒的编程原则，程序的函数不要太长。如果某些函数超出了屏幕，那么它会变成一团麻，这很容易掩盖错误，就像大城市很容易掩盖罪犯一样。这种软件将难以阅读，难以测试，难以调试。</p>

<p>按照这一原则，大块程序必须分成小块程序，并且，程序越大，越要分。那么如何划分呢？传统的做法是自上而下设计: 程序的目的是做这样七件事情，所以分成七个子程序。第一个子程序要做四件事情，那么再分四个子例程。这样持续下去，直到整个程序拥有正确的粒度，每部分都足够做一些真正的事情，还要足够小，这样把它理解为一个单元。</p>

<p>然而有经验的lisp程序员使用不同的方式来分割程序。就像自上而下设计一样，他们遵循自下而上设计&#8211;让语言适应问题。在lisp中，你不仅面向语言编写程序，你还会面向程序构建程序。当你在写程序时，你会想，我希望lisp有这样这样的操作符。于是你就把它写好了。之后你意识到使用另外一个新的操作符会简化另外一部分程序的设计，等等。语言和程序彼此交织在一起。就像敌对国家的边界一样，语言和程序的边界也在不停重画，直到山川、河流为止，也就是你的问题的自然边界。最后，你的程序看起来好像就是为这个问题设计的一样。当语言和程序彼此适合后，你的工作也就结束了，代码干净，短小，高效。</p>

<p>值得强调的是，自下而上设计并不只是一种不同的方式。当你自下而上编程时，你会得到一段不一样的程序。不像单一庞大的程序，你会得到一个更大的语言，拥有更多抽象操作符，使用它写了一段短小的程序。不是门梁，而是拱形。</p>

<p>在一段经典的代码中，一旦你抽象出了账簿部分，剩下的就更短了；你构建的语言越高级，从上到下的路程就更短。这带来还能多优势：</p>

<p>通过让语言做更多的工作，自下而上设计会生成更小更灵活的程序。短小的程序并不需要被分成很多组件，越少的组件意味着程序更加易读和修改。更少的组件意味着，组件之间更少的联系，并且，有更少的错误。工业设计师努力减少机器中移动部件的数量，有经验的lisp程序员使用自下而上设计减少程序的大小和复杂性。</p>

<p>自下而上设计促进代码的可重用性。当你写两个或更多程序时，你在第一个程序中写的很多工具也会在接下来的的程序中很有用。一旦你获得了一个很大的工具集，写新的程序往往只需要写原始的lisp程序的一部分努力。</p>

<p>自下而上设计使得程序更容易阅读，这种抽象类型的实例要求读者理解一个通用的操作；功能抽象的程序要求读者理解子程序的用途。</p>

<p>因为这会迫使你经常查找你代码的模式，自下而上设计帮助你理清程序设计的想法。程序中两个不相干的组件在形式上看起来很像的话，你就会注意到这其中的相似性，然后以更简单的方式重新设计程序。</p>

<p>除了lisp，自下而上设计在其他语言中会达到一定的深度。不管什么时候看到库函数，自下而上就会出现。然而在这方面，lisp会给你更大的能力，提高语言在使用lisp方式中的比重&#8211;这样看来，lisp不仅仅是一种不同的编程语言，而是一种完全不同的编程方式。</p>

<p>事实上，这种开发方式，跟适合小团体。同时，它也突破了小团队的局限。在人月神话中，frederick brooks提出，一组程序员的生产力并不会随着人数的增加而线性增加。当团队的人数增加时，个人程序员的生产力就下降了。lisp编程的经历会用更激动人心的方式来叙述：当团队人数减少时，单个程序员的生产力就提升了。相对来说，小团队胜利了，只是因为小。当小团队使用了lisp的技术后，就会彻底完胜。</p>

<p>===============================</p>

<p>programming bottom-up
1993
(This essay is from the introduction to On Lisp. The red text explains the origins of Arc&#8217;s name.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a long-standing principle of programming style that the functional elements of a program should not be too large. If some component of a program grows beyond the stage where it&#8217;s readily comprehensible, it becomes a mass of complexity which conceals errors as easily as a big city conceals fugitives. Such software will be hard to read, hard to test, and hard to debug.</p>

<p>In accordance with this principle, a large program must be divided into pieces, and the larger the program, the more it must be divided. How do you divide a program? The traditional approach is called top-down design: you say &#8220;the purpose of the program is to do these seven things, so I divide it into seven major subroutines. The first subroutine has to do these four things, so it in turn will have four of its own subroutines,&#8221; and so on. This process continues until the whole program has the right level of granularity&#8211; each part large enough to do something substantial, but small enough to be understood as a single unit.</p>

<p>Experienced Lisp programmers divide up their programs differently. As well as top-down design, they follow a principle which could be called bottom-up design&#8211; changing the language to suit the problem. In Lisp, you don&#8217;t just write your program down toward the language, you also build the language up toward your program. As you&#8217;re writing a program you may think &#8220;I wish Lisp had such-and-such an operator.&#8221; So you go and write it. Afterward you realize that using the new operator would simplify the design of another part of the program, and so on. Language and program evolve together. Like the border between two warring states, the boundary between language and program is drawn and redrawn, until eventually it comes to rest along the mountains and rivers, the natural frontiers of your problem. In the end your program will look as if the language had been designed for it. And when language and program fit one another well, you end up with code which is clear, small, and efficient.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn&#8217;t mean just writing the same program in a different order. When you work bottom-up, you usually end up with a different program. Instead of a single, monolithic program, you will get a larger language with more abstract operators, and a smaller program written in it. Instead of a lintel, you&#8217;ll get an arch.</p>

<p>In typical code, once you abstract out the parts which are merely bookkeeping, what&#8217;s left is much shorter; the higher you build up the language, the less distance you will have to travel from the top down to it. This brings several advantages:</p>

<p>By making the language do more of the work, bottom-up design yields programs which are smaller and more agile. A shorter program doesn&#8217;t have to be divided into so many components, and fewer components means programs which are easier to read or modify. Fewer components also means fewer connections between components, and thus less chance for errors there. As industrial designers strive to reduce the number of moving parts in a machine, experienced Lisp programmers use bottom-up design to reduce the size and complexity of their programs.
Bottom-up design promotes code re-use. When you write two or more programs, many of the utilities you wrote for the first program will also be useful in the succeeding ones. Once you&#8217;ve acquired a large substrate of utilities, writing a new program can take only a fraction of the effort it would require if you had to start with raw Lisp.</p>

<p>Bottom-up design makes programs easier to read. An instance of this type of abstraction asks the reader to understand a general-purpose operator; an instance of functional abstraction asks the reader to understand a special-purpose subroutine. [1]</p>

<p>Because it causes you always to be on the lookout for patterns in your code, working bottom-up helps to clarify your ideas about the design of your program. If two distant components of a program are similar in form, you&#8217;ll be led to notice the similarity and perhaps to redesign the program in a simpler way.
Bottom-up design is possible to a certain degree in languages other than Lisp. Whenever you see library functions, bottom-up design is happening. However, Lisp gives you much broader powers in this department, and augmenting the language plays a proportionately larger role in Lisp style&#8211; so much so that Lisp is not just a different language, but a whole different way of programming.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s true that this style of development is better suited to programs which can be written by small groups. However, at the same time, it extends the limits of what can be done by a small group. In The Mythical Man-Month, Frederick Brooks proposed that the productivity of a group of programmers does not grow linearly with its size. As the size of the group increases, the productivity of individual programmers goes down. The experience of Lisp programming suggests a more cheerful way to phrase this law: as the size of the group decreases, the productivity of individual programmers goes up. A small group wins, relatively speaking, simply because it&#8217;s smaller. When a small group also takes advantage of the techniques that Lisp makes possible, it can win outright.</p>

<p>[1] &#8220;But no one can read the program without understanding all your new utilities.&#8221; To see why such statements are usually mistaken, see Section 4.8.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.paulgrahamcn.com/article/beatingtheaverages">打败平庸</a></p>

<p>(本文取自2001年在 Franz 开发者大会的一篇演讲)</p>

<p>1995年夏天，朋友Rober Morris 和我创办了Viaweb，我们计划写一个让用户建立在线商店的软件。当时新颖的是，软件运行在我们的服务器上，使用普通的网页作为界面。</p>

<p>当然，当时可能很多人有同样的想法。但是据我所知，Viaweb是第一个基于网页的。对于我们来说，这是一个非常新颖的主意，之后我们给公司起名：Viaweb。因为我们的软件是通过网站，而不是运行在你的电脑桌面上。</p>

<p>软件另一点不寻常的地方是，我们使用一个叫做Lisp的语言编写。这是最早用Lisp写的大型终端软件之一，在此之前，Lisp主要用在大学和研究室里。</p>

<p>The Secret Weapon
秘密武器</p>

<p>Eric Raymond写过一篇文章，“怎样成为黑客”，其中，他告诉将来的黑客应该学习什么编程语言。他建议从python或者java开始，因为它们很简单。高级黑客还应当学习c，来理解Unix；学习Perl，来管理系统和CGI。最后，真正的高级黑客需要考虑学习Lisp：</p>

<p>“lisp值得学习，当你最终掌握它时，你会获得深厚的启示经历；这段经历会让你今后成为一个更好的程序员，即使以后不会常常用到它。“</p>

<p>你会听到相同的学习拉丁语的原因。拉丁语不会给你一份工作，除非要当个古希腊文化教授，但是它能提升你的思想，让你成为一个更好的使用其它语言的作家，比如英语。</p>

<p>但是这个比喻在此并不适用。之所以学习拉丁语不能给你一份工作，是因为没人使用。如果你用它写作，没人能理解。但是Lisp是一个计算机的语言，计算机可以理解程序员告知它的任何语言。</p>

<p>但是，就像他说的，假如Lisp能让你成为一个更好的程序员，那你为什么不会去用它？假如一根画笔能让某人成为一个更好的画家，他应该会用这根画笔去画他所有的作品，不是吗？我不是想在这讽刺Eric Raymond。总体来说，他的建议是很好的。只是他对Lisp的看法是传统的观点，而这个观点有自相矛盾的地方，即Lisp能让你成为一个更好的程序员，但是你不会去使用它。</p>

<p>为什么不用？本质上，编程语言只是工具而已。如果Lisp确实能写出更好的程序，你当然应该用它；如果它不能，那没人会用它。</p>

<p>这不仅仅是一个理论问题。软件业是个竞争很激烈的行业，优胜劣汰。在其他条件一样的情况下，软件写的又快又好的公司，就能打败他的竞争对手。当你创业的时候，这种感觉是非常强烈的。要么得到所有，要么一无所有。不是富豪，就是穷光蛋。在创业起初，如果选错了技术，你的竞争对手就会干掉你。</p>

<p>Robert和我都很了解Lisp，我们找不到任何理由不去相信自己的直觉。其他人都用C++或者Perl，但那与我们无关。如果你准备和他们一样，那你一定在用Windows。从技术角度出发，你得忽略其他人的普遍做法，而只去思考最佳方案。</p>

<p>这更加适用于创业。大公司，可以做其他大公司都在做的事。但是创业公司不能这样。很多人没意识到这点，即使是创业者。</p>

<p>大企业平均每年增长10%的利润。所以如果你在管理大企业，那么就做一般大公司做的事情，只能期望一个一般的表现——每年10%左右的增长。</p>

<p>当然，这对创业者来说，也是一样。假如你和其他创业公司做一样的事情，你也只能有一般的表现。问题是，那样的表现意味着你会破产。创业公司的存活率低于50%。所以，如果你将要创业，最好另辟蹊径，否则，你就会陷入困境。</p>

<p>在1995年，我们明白一些其他竞争者不了解，即使现在也很少人理解的东西：写一个只会运行在自己的服务器上的软件时，你可以用任何你喜欢的语言。而当写个人桌面软件时，一种强烈的偏见是，你必须使用和操作系统一样的语言。10年前，编写应用程序意味着用C。但是基于网络的软件，特别是当你拥有操作系统和语言的源码时，你可以使用任何语言。</p>

<p>尽管如此，这种新的自由却是一把双刃剑。你可以使用任何语言，就得好好想想用哪种。那些不愿意冒险作出改变的公司会发现，他们的竞争对手可不一样。</p>

<p>如果你可以使用任何语言，你会选哪个？我们选择Lisp。首先，很明显，快速开发在这个市场是很重要的。我们都是白手起家，所以能早于竞争对手推出新功能就会有很大的优势。我们知道Lisp是一种编写软件非常快的语言，而基于服务器的软件又放大了这种影响，因为你可以在编写完成的第一时间发布你的软件。</p>

<p>如果其他公司不想用Lisp，那正好。这也许会让我们处于技术的边缘，我们需要任何可以得到的帮助。当我们创办Viaweb时，我们对毫无商业经验。我们对市场，雇佣员工，赚钱，吸引顾客都一无所知。我们俩也都没实际工作过，只擅长编写软件，我们希望这能拯救我们。我们要利用一切优势。</p>

<p>你可以说使用Lisp是一次实验。我们的设想是，假如用Lisp写软件，那就能比竞争对手更快的完成软件，能作对手作不到的事。因为Lisp的高级特性，我们不需要一个大的开发团队，所以花费也更少。如果能这样，我们就能提供更好的产品，或者更低的价格，仍然可以盈利。逐渐的，我们就能得到所有的客户，而对手们什么都得不到，直到退出这个行业。当然，这就是我们所期望的。</p>

<p>实验的结果如何？让人吃惊的是，成功了。一开始 我们有很多竞争对手，大约2，30个，但是他们的软件都无法和我们的相比。我们有一个所见即所得的在线商店创建程序，运行在服务器上，但是和个人桌面应用 程序没什么两样。竞争对手们使用CGI脚本，而我们总是在功能上遥遥领先。有时候，对手会拼命宣传我们没有的功能。但是Lisp大大缩短了开发周期，以至 于我们能在1到2天之内就复制一个竞争对手刚刚发布的新功能。当记者报道他们新发布的版本的时候，我们也有了同样的功能。</p>

<p>在竞争对手看来，我们似乎有某种秘密武器——我们能解密他们的Enigma机器或者别的东西。事实上，我们确实有一个秘密武器，但是比他们想象的简单得多。没有人泄露他们的秘密给我们，我们只是能以别人意想不到的速度开发软件。</p>

<p>我9岁的时候，看过Frederick Forsyth写的《刺杀戴高乐》。主角是一个被雇佣来刺杀法国总统的刺客。那个刺客需要越过警察，到一个可以俯瞰总统行走路径的旅馆。他从警察正面走过，伪装成一个杵着拐杖的老头，没有人对他起疑心。</p>

<p>我们的秘密武器也是这样。我们用一个充满了怪异括号，古怪的人工智能语言编写软件。很多年前，我对Lisp的这个特点感到厌烦，但是它现在却成了我们的优势。商业上，最强的技术优势就是，你用着竞争者不懂的技术。商业，和打仗一样，出奇才能制胜。</p>

<p>所 以，有点惭愧的说，当我们在作Viaweb的时候，从未在公开场合提到Lisp。我们从来没有对媒体提到它，如果你在我们网站上搜索Lisp，只会找到2 本我的藏书。这不奇怪，创业公司透露给它的竞争对手的信息越少越好。如果他们不知道，或者不关心我们的软件用什么写的，那正合我意。[2]</p>

<p>最 了解我们技术的是客户们。他们不关心Viaweb是用什么写的，只是知道它很好用。他们可以用Viaweb几分钟就建好一个漂亮的在线商店，所以，一传 十，十传百，我们有了越来越多的客户。1996年底，我们的在线商店是70个左右。1997年年底，我们有了500个。6个月后，当Yahoo收购我们 时，有1070个用户。今天，作为Yahoo Store，这个软件依旧统治着市场。也是Yahoo盈利很多的商品之一，而用它建立的商店，则是Yahoo Shopping的基础。我1999年离开Yahoo，所以不知道他们现在有多少用户了，但是最近一次听说是20000。</p>

<p>The Blub Paradox
Blub矛盾原则</p>

<p>Lisp 到底强在哪里？如果Lisp这么强大，为什么这么少人用？听起来是个复杂的问题，但是答案很直接：Lisp不仅因为，只有喜欢它的人才能看到它的强大，还 因为它是你可以使用的最强大的语言。不是所有人都用Lisp的原因是，编程语言不只是技术，还包括头脑的习惯，而这些改变起来都很缓慢。当然，这里需要解 释一下。</p>

<p>我从一个非常有争议的声明开始说起：编程语言的威力是不一样的</p>

<p>至少，大部分人会同意，高级语言比机器语言强大。如今，很多程序员都明白，用机器语言写程序很傻。你应该用高级语言，让编译器去把它转换成机器语言。这个观点甚至被用在硬件上了：20世纪80年代以来，汇编指令集开始为编译器设计，而不是为程序员。</p>

<p>所有人都知道手写机器语言编写程序是错误的。但很多人没理解另一个通用的观点：如果你可以选择许多种语言，他们其他地方都一样，那只有用最有威力的才是唯一正确的选择。[3]</p>

<p>这 个观点有很多例外。如果你需要写一个和某个语言写的程序工作很接近的程序，也许用同样的语言写这个程序会是个不错的选择；如果你需要写一个只作很简单的， 比如数字，位处理，你也许应该用抽象程度不那么高的语言，特别是当它能够运行得更快的时候；如果你只想写一个临时程序，也许你该用对这个任务来说，有最佳 的函数库的语言。但是，总的说来，对于应用程序，你应该能使用最有威力（最有效率）的语言。用别的语言都是个错误，因为那样几乎等于，虽然夸哦张了点，是 在用机器语言编程。</p>

<p>你们都知道机器语言是很低级的。但是，以社会上的普遍观点来说，高级语言通常都被认为是差不多的，其实不然。从技术上说，“高级语言”并不是一个精确的定义，而在低级语言和高级语言之间也没有明确的分界线。根据抽象程度的高低，编程语言形成了一个有序的梯队列表。[4]</p>

<p>看看Cobol。Cobol是一个高级语言，因为它需要编译成机器语言执行。但是会有人认真的说Cobol的威力和，比如Python，是一样的吗？它显然比Python更接近机器语言。</p>

<p>那 么Perl 4呢？从Perl 4到Perl 5，词法闭包添加了进来。大多数Perl黑客会同意，Perl 5比Perl 4更强大。一旦你也这么觉得，那就意味着你承认，一种高级语言可以比另一种更强大。除非特殊情况，接下来你自然会想要去用能得到的，最强大的语言。</p>

<p>但是，这个想法很少会和上述结论吻合。岁月流逝，程序员极少积极的更换使用的语言。人们一旦习惯使用某种语言，他们就会满足现状。</p>

<p>程序员和他们喜爱的语言特别亲近，而我也不想伤害任何人的情感。因此，为了说明这个观点，我将使用一个假设的语言：Blub。Blub处于语言抽象程度列表的中间位置，它不是最强大的语言，但是比Cobol或者机器语言要强大。</p>

<p>而事实上，我们的Blub程序员2者都不会用。他当然不会想要用机器语言写程序，那是编译器干的事。至于Cobol，他不了解怎么用它解决问题，因为它没有X功能(设想的某种功能)。</p>

<p>我 们假设的Blub程序员如果从语言抽象程度列表往下看，他能知道自己是在往下看。比Blub弱的语言明显的弱很多，因为缺少他已经习惯的一些功能。但是， 假如我们的Blub程序员从相反的方向去看，他却不会觉得自己是在往上看。因为他看到的都是古怪的语言。他也许会认为那都是和Blub差不多的语言，只是 长相稀奇古怪而已。Blub对他来说足够了，因为他是在用Blub思考。</p>

<p>当我们从另外一个，使用更高级的语言的程序员的角度来看时，又会如何？你用Blub能作什么呢？它连Y功能都没有。</p>

<p>简 单的说，只有理解最强大语言的程序员，才会对整个列表的高级语言的威力，有一个全面的了解。（这也许就是Eric Raymond说的，Lisp会让你成为一个更好的程序员的原因。）你不能相信其他人的看法，因为Blub矛盾原则：他们对自己习惯的语言感到满足，因为 这符合他们思考程序的方式。</p>

<p>我自己的经历证明了这点，当时我还在高中用Basic写程序时。那种语言甚至不支持递归。很难想象不用递归来写程，但是我当时不这么觉得。我以Basic的方式思考，成了Basic的专家，掌握了所有我能了解到的。</p>

<p>Eric Raymond推荐给黑客的5种语言，位于语言威力列表中不同的位置，而他们之间的比较则是个容易引起争吵的话题。我想说的是，我觉得Lisp是在最顶层 的。为了证明这个观点，我会指出一个其他四种语言没有的特性。他们甚至不支持宏(Macro)，我能用它能作什么呢？[5]</p>

<p>许多语言都一 个被叫做“宏”的东西，但是Lisp的宏是不同的。信不信由你，它们作的都是和括号相关的。Lisp的设计者并不是只是为了与众不同才使用那么多括号。对 Blub程序员来说，Lisp的代码看起来很古怪。但是，这些括号的出现是有原因的。这使得Lisp从外表上看起来，和其他语言有本质的不同。</p>

<p>Lisp代码是由Lisp数据对象组成的。别的语言一般会设计成：源文件包含字符，字符串是则是该语言所支持的数据类型之一。而当解析器读取Lisp代码时，你会发现Lisp是由你可以遍历的数据结构组成的。</p>

<p>如 果你明白编译原理，就会可以理解Lisp的这种奇怪的语法，或者说没有语法的语法。其他语言会被编译器解析成解析树，而你在Lisp中，就是用这种解析树 的结构写程序。这些解析树对你的程序来说是可读的，因此就可以写程序来维护它们。在Lisp里，这样的程序称为宏。它们是可以生成程序的程序。</p>

<p>可 以生成程序的程序？什么时候会需要这么作？如果你用Cobol的方式思考，这种需求并不常见；如果用Lisp的方式思考，你会经常想要这么作。这里如果能 给出一个强大的宏的例子，也许会比较方便阐明。但是对一个不懂Lisp的人来说，会觉得那像是在胡扯，我没办法把需要让你理解宏的预备知识在这里说清楚。 在《Ansi Common Lisp》这本书里，我已经很快的引导读者理解所有的东西，尽管如此，在160页之前，我都没有提到宏。</p>

<p>我 能给出一个有说服力的例子。Viaweb编辑器的源码有20％－25％是宏。宏比普通的Lisp函数要难写，在不需要的地方使用也是个坏习惯。所以，宏存 在于那里是因为它必须存在。这就是说，在这个程序里，有20％－25％的部分是你用别的语言难以实现的。Blub程序员可能会对我声称的，Lisp如此神 气的威力，感到怀疑和好奇。我们写这些代码不是只给自己看看而已。我们是个很小的创业公司，所以尽最大的力在我们和竞争者之间构筑了一道技术的壁垒。</p>

<p>感到疑惑的人也许会想，你说的这些东西都有什么关联？我们的一大段代码，是在作用别的语言很难实现的工作，这样，我们就能人所不能。也许这就是关键所在，我鼓励你顺着这个角度去思考。也许这个杵着拐杖的老头可不简单哦。</p>

<p>Aikido for Startups
创业之道</p>

<p>我 不指望说服所有的人(大于25岁)都去学Lisp。这篇文章的目的不是改变别人的想法，而是给那些对Lisp有兴趣的人信心。他们已经知道Lisp是一个 强大的语言，但是因为它没有被广泛的使用而感到担忧。在竞赛中，这是一种优势。因为你的竞争对手用不了它，所以Lisp的优势还被放大了。</p>

<p>如 果你想要用Lisp创业，不需要因为它不被广泛的理解而感到担忧。你应该觉得那样很好。人们普遍对于他们当前使用的语言很满意。计算机硬件的发展速度比人 们习惯的改变速度快得多，实际编程比处理器要落后10到20年。像在MIT，他们早在20世纪60年代就开始用高级语言写程序了，而很多公司在80年代之 前都还在用机器语言。我敢打赌，处理器换到RISC指令集时，相当大一部分用机器语言写代码的人失了业。</p>

<p>通常说来，技术更新是很快 的。但是编程语言不一样：编程不止是技术，也是程序员思维的方式。他们是半技术，半宗教信仰的东西。[6]所以，流行的语言，即大部分程序员使用的语言， 发展像冰山一样缓慢。垃圾回收，大约20世纪60年代由Lisp引入，现在普遍被认为是个好东西；运行时输入(runtime typing)，同上，现在开始流行起来；词法闭包，20世纪70年代由Lisp引入，现在少量的运用在雷达技术上。宏，20世纪60年代由Lisp引 入，现在还是未开垦的领域。</p>

<p>当然，流行的语言有强大的势力，我不是想让你去对抗。相反，像合气道(译者：日本的一种竞技项目)一样，你可以用它来对付竞争对手。</p>

<p>如果你在一家大公司工作，也许没那么容易。说服一个头发油光锃亮的老板是个艰难的任务，而他也许正好读到某篇报道，说某某语言，就像20年前的Ada一样，将要占领这个行业。但假如你在创业公司工作，也没有那种油光锃亮的老板，那就好好利用Blub矛盾原则提到的优势，就像我们一样：你可以使用，那些坚持使用流行语言的竞争对手，永远无法匹敌的技术。</p>

<p>如果你在一个创业公司工作，这里有一些可用于评估对手的提示：查看他们的招聘岗位。他们网站上的其他东西也许会是股票照片，或者之类的。但是职位需求肯定会反映出他们要什么样的员工，否则无法得到想要的候选人。</p>

<p>我在Viaweb工作的几年里，查看过很多的职位描述。每个月都会有新的竞争者冒出来。我首先作的通常是，看看他们是否有在线的demo，然后去查看他们的招聘信息。很多年之后，我可以知道那些公司需要注意，而那些不需要。最安全的是那些需要Oracle经验的，你不需要担心他们。如果他们需要C++或者 java开发者，你同样不需要担心。如果他们想要Perl或者Python程序员，那就得小心了——看起来这家公司是搞技术的，至少，他们是真的黑客创办 的。如果看到招聘Lisp黑客的信息，我就会非常担心。</p>

<p>Notes
注释</p>

<p>[1]起初Viaweb有2部分：编辑器，用Lisp编写的，用户们用它来建立站点；请求处理系统，用C编写，处理请求。初版基本上是Lisp，因为请求处理系统很小。后来我们增加了2个模块，用C写的一个图像生成器，用Perl写的一个后台管理系统。</p>

<p>2003年1月，Yahoo发布了用C++和Perl写的新版本。很难说这个程序是否还是Lisp写的，因为要把它移植到C++，他们需要写一个Lisp解释器：构建页面模板的源文件，就我所知，还是Lisp代码。</p>

<p>[2]Rober Morris说我不需要保密，因为即使竞争者们知道我们用Lisp，他们也不会理解为什么：“假如他们有那么聪明的话，他们早就用Lisp编程了。“</p>

<p>[3] 因为图灵等价，所以很多语言被认为威力差不多，但是这不是程序员关心的。（没人想要写一个图灵机）。NB的程序员到底关心什么不好说，一种可能的解释是： 那些只能通过为更强大语言写一个解释器，才能在较弱的语言中获得的功能。如果语言A有一个操作符可以把字串中的空格去掉，而语言B没这个，那并不意味只A 就更强大。因为你大可在B里写一个类似的函数。但是假如A支持，比如递归，而B不支持，那可就不是你写一个函数库可以解决的问题了。</p>

<p>[4]呆头呆脑和断章取义的人注意：重要的是这里存在一个抽象的顺序，它到底长什么形状并不重要。</p>

<p>[5]把宏作为一个单独的功能列出来，有些不妥。实际上，他们的功效需要和其他的Lisp功能，比如词法闭包，变参等，一起才能发挥最大作用。</p>

<p>[6]结果是，对编程语言的比较要么是以“宗教战争”的形式，要么就像本科教材里面那样尽量中立的表述。对于看重和平，明哲保身的人来说，他们会避免这个话题。但是这个问题其实只是半宗教的：有些东西还是值得你去学习，特别是当你想要设计新语言的时候。</p>

Beating The Averages</p>

<p>Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator.</p>

<p>(This article is derived from a talk given at the 2001 Franz Developer Symposium.)</p>

<p>In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I started a startup called Viaweb. Our plan was to write software that would let end users build online stores. What was novel about this software, at the time, was that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages as the interface.</p>

<p>A lot of people could have been having this idea at the same time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb was the first Web-based application. It seemed such a novel idea to us that we named the company after it: Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web, instead of running on your desktop computer.</p>

<p>Another unusual thing about this software was that it was written primarily in a programming language called Lisp. It was one of the first big end-user applications to be written in Lisp, which up till then had been used mostly in universities and research labs. [1]</p>

<p>The Secret Weapon</p>

<p>Eric Raymond has written an essay called &#8220;How to Become a Hacker,&#8221; and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what languages they should learn. He suggests starting with Python and Java, because they are easy to learn. The serious hacker will also want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system administration and cgi scripts. Finally, the truly serious hacker should consider learning Lisp:</p>

<p>Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.</p>

<p>This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin. It won&#8217;t get you a job, except perhaps as a classics professor, but it will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages you do want to use, like English.</p>

<p>But wait a minute. This metaphor doesn&#8217;t stretch that far. The reason Latin won&#8217;t get you a job is that no one speaks it. If you write in Latin, no one can understand you. But Lisp is a computer language, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer, tell them to.</p>

<p>So if Lisp makes you a better programmer, like he says, why wouldn&#8217;t you want to use it? If a painter were offered a brush that would make him a better painter, it seems to me that he would want to use it in all his paintings, wouldn&#8217;t he? I&#8217;m not trying to make fun of Eric Raymond here. On the whole, his advice is good. What he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom. But there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom: Lisp will make you a better programmer, and yet you won&#8217;t use it.</p>

<p>Why not? Programming languages are just tools, after all. If Lisp really does yield better programs, you should use it. And if it doesn&#8217;t, then who needs it?</p>

<p>This is not just a theoretical question. Software is a very competitive business, prone to natural monopolies. A company that gets software written faster and better will, all other things being equal, put its competitors out of business. And when you&#8217;re starting a startup, you feel this very keenly. Startups tend to be an all or nothing proposition. You either get rich, or you get nothing. In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your competitors will crush you.</p>

<p>Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn&#8217;t see any reason not to trust our instincts and go with Lisp. We knew that everyone else was writing their software in C++ or Perl. But we also knew that that didn&#8217;t mean anything. If you chose technology that way, you&#8217;d be running Windows. When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will work the best.</p>

<p>This is especially true in a startup. In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing. But a startup can&#8217;t do what all the other startups do. I don&#8217;t think a lot of people realize this, even in startups.</p>

<p>The average big company grows at about ten percent a year. So if you&#8217;re running a big company and you do everything the way the average big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the average big company&#8211; that is, to grow about ten percent a year.</p>

<p>The same thing will happen if you&#8217;re running a startup, of course. If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance. The problem here is, average performance means that you&#8217;ll go out of business. The survival rate for startups is way less than fifty percent. So if you&#8217;re running a startup, you had better be doing something odd. If not, you&#8217;re in trouble.</p>

<p>Back in 1995, we knew something that I don&#8217;t think our competitors understood, and few understand even now: when you&#8217;re writing software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use any language you want. When you&#8217;re writing desktop software, there&#8217;s a strong bias toward writing applications in the same language as the operating system. Ten years ago, writing applications meant writing applications in C. But with Web-based software, especially when you have the source code of both the language and the operating system, you can use whatever language you want.</p>

<p>This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however. Now that you can use any language, you have to think about which one to use. Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that their competitors do not.</p>

<p>If you can use any language, which do you use? We chose Lisp. For one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would be important in this market. We were all starting from scratch, so a company that could get new features done before its competitors would have a big advantage. We knew Lisp was a really good language for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify the effect of rapid development, because you can release software the minute it&#8217;s done.</p>

<p>If other companies didn&#8217;t want to use Lisp, so much the better. It might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the help we could get. When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in business. We didn&#8217;t know anything about marketing, or hiring people, or raising money, or getting customers. Neither of us had ever even had what you would call a real job. The only thing we were good at was writing software. We hoped that would save us. Any advantage we could get in the software department, we would take.</p>

<p>So you could say that using Lisp was an experiment. Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we&#8217;d be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they couldn&#8217;t do. And because Lisp was so high-level, we wouldn&#8217;t need a big development team, so our costs would be lower. If this were so, we could offer a better product for less money, and still make a profit. We would end up getting all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually go out of business. That was what we hoped would happen, anyway.</p>

<p>What were the results of this experiment? Somewhat surprisingly, it worked. We eventually had many competitors, on the order of twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete with ours. We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the server and yet felt like a desktop application. Our competitors had cgi scripts. And we were always far ahead of them in features. Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce features that we didn&#8217;t have. But with Lisp our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release. By the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling us, we would have the new feature too.</p>

<p>It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon&#8211; that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or something. In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler than they realized. No one was leaking news of their features to us. We were just able to develop software faster than anyone thought possible.</p>

<p>When I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy of The Day of the Jackal, by Frederick Forsyth. The main character is an assassin who is hired to kill the president of France. The assassin has to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooks the president&#8217;s route. He walks right by them, dressed up as an old man on crutches, and they never suspect him.</p>

<p>Our secret weapon was similar. We wrote our software in a weird AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses. For years it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way. But now it worked to our advantage. In business, there is nothing more valuable than a technical advantage your competitors don&#8217;t understand. In business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.</p>

<p>And so, I&#8217;m a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything publicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb. We never mentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web site, all you&#8217;d find were the titles of two books in my bio. This was no accident. A startup should give its competitors as little information as possible. If they didn&#8217;t know what language our software was written in, or didn&#8217;t care, I wanted to keep it that way.[2]</p>

<p>The people who understood our technology best were the customers. They didn&#8217;t care what language Viaweb was written in either, but they noticed that it worked really well. It let them build great looking online stores literally in minutes. And so, by word of mouth mostly, we got more and more users. By the end of 1996 we had about 70 stores online. At the end of 1997 we had 500. Six months later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users. Today, as Yahoo Store, this software continues to dominate its market. It&#8217;s one of the more profitable pieces of Yahoo, and the stores built with it are the foundation of Yahoo Shopping. I left Yahoo in 1999, so I don&#8217;t know exactly how many users they have now, but the last I heard there were about 20,000.</p>

<p>The Blub Paradox</p>

<p>What&#8217;s so great about Lisp? And if Lisp is so great, why doesn&#8217;t everyone use it? These sound like rhetorical questions, but actually they have straightforward answers. Lisp is so great not because of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is simply the most powerful language available. And the reason everyone doesn&#8217;t use it is that programming languages are not merely technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes slower. Of course, both these answers need explaining.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll begin with a shockingly controversial statement: programming languages vary in power.</p>

<p>Few would dispute, at least, that high level languages are more powerful than machine language. Most programmers today would agree that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language. Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a compiler translate it into machine language for you. This idea is even built into the hardware now: since the 1980s, instruction sets have been designed for compilers rather than human programmers.</p>

<p>Everyone knows it&#8217;s a mistake to write your whole program by hand in machine language. What&#8217;s less often understood is that there is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one. [3]</p>

<p>There are many exceptions to this rule. If you&#8217;re writing a program that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the same language. If you&#8217;re writing a program that only has to do something very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation, you may as well use a less abstract language, especially since it may be slightly faster. And if you&#8217;re writing a short, throwaway program, you may be better off just using whatever language has the best library functions for the task. But in general, for application software, you want to be using the most powerful (reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything else is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a lesser degree, as programming in machine language.</p>

<p>You can see that machine language is very low level. But, at least as a kind of social convention, high-level languages are often all treated as equivalent. They&#8217;re not. Technically the term &#8220;high-level language&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean anything very definite. There&#8217;s no dividing line with machine languages on one side and all the high-level languages on the other. Languages fall along a continuum [4] of abstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine languages, which themselves vary in power.</p>

<p>Consider Cobol. Cobol is a high-level language, in the sense that it gets compiled into machine language. Would anyone seriously argue that Cobol is equivalent in power to, say, Python? It&#8217;s probably closer to machine language than Python.</p>

<p>Or how about Perl 4? Between Perl 4 and Perl 5, lexical closures got added to the language. Most Perl hackers would agree that Perl 5 is more powerful than Perl 4. But once you&#8217;ve admitted that, you&#8217;ve admitted that one high level language can be more powerful than another. And it follows inexorably that, except in special cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.</p>

<p>This idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though. After a certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily. Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider just good enough.</p>

<p>Programmers get very attached to their favorite languages, and I don&#8217;t want to hurt anyone&#8217;s feelings, so to explain this point I&#8217;m going to use a hypothetical language called Blub. Blub falls right in the middle of the abstractness continuum. It is not the most powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine language.</p>

<p>And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn&#8217;t use either of them. Of course he wouldn&#8217;t program in machine language. That&#8217;s what compilers are for. And as for Cobol, he doesn&#8217;t know how anyone can get anything done with it. It doesn&#8217;t even have x (Blub feature of your choice).</p>

<p>As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum, he knows he&#8217;s looking down. Languages less powerful than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they&#8217;re missing some feature he&#8217;s used to. But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn&#8217;t realize he&#8217;s looking up. What he sees are merely weird languages. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.</p>

<p>When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that he in turn looks down upon Blub. How can you get anything done in Blub? It doesn&#8217;t even have y.</p>

<p>By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the differences in power between the various languages are those who understand the most powerful one. (This is probably what Eric Raymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.) You can&#8217;t trust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox: they&#8217;re satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs.</p>

<p>I know this from my own experience, as a high school kid writing programs in Basic. That language didn&#8217;t even support recursion. It&#8217;s hard to imagine writing programs without using recursion, but I didn&#8217;t miss it at the time. I thought in Basic. And I was a whiz at it. Master of all I surveyed.</p>

<p>The five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall at various points on the power continuum. Where they fall relative to one another is a sensitive topic. What I will say is that I think Lisp is at the top. And to support this claim I&#8217;ll tell you about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other four languages. How can you get anything done in them, I think, without macros? [5]</p>

<p>Many languages have something called a macro. But Lisp macros are unique. And believe it or not, what they do is related to the parentheses. The designers of Lisp didn&#8217;t put all those parentheses in the language just to be different. To the Blub programmer, Lisp code looks weird. But those parentheses are there for a reason. They are the outward evidence of a fundamental difference between Lisp and other languages.</p>

<p>Lisp code is made out of Lisp data objects. And not in the trivial sense that the source files contain characters, and strings are one of the data types supported by the language. Lisp code, after it&#8217;s read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can traverse.</p>

<p>If you understand how compilers work, what&#8217;s really going on is not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no syntax. You write programs in the parse trees that get generated within the compiler when other languages are parsed. But these parse trees are fully accessible to your programs. You can write programs that manipulate them. In Lisp, these programs are called macros. They are programs that write programs.</p>

<p>Programs that write programs? When would you ever want to do that? Not very often, if you think in Cobol. All the time, if you think in Lisp. It would be convenient here if I could give an example of a powerful macro, and say there! how about that? But if I did, it would just look like gibberish to someone who didn&#8217;t know Lisp; there isn&#8217;t room here to explain everything you&#8217;d need to know to understand what it meant. In Ansi Common Lisp I tried to move things along as fast as I could, and even so I didn&#8217;t get to macros until page 160.</p>

<p>But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing. The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25% macros. Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions, and it&#8217;s considered to be bad style to use them when they&#8217;re not necessary. So every macro in that code is there because it has to be. What that means is that at least 20-25% of the code in this program is doing things that you can&#8217;t easily do in any other language. However skeptical the Blub programmer might be about my claims for the mysterious powers of Lisp, this ought to make him curious. We weren&#8217;t writing this code for our own amusement. We were a tiny startup, programming as hard as we could in order to put technical barriers between us and our competitors.</p>

<p>A suspicious person might begin to wonder if there was some correlation here. A big chunk of our code was doing things that are very hard to do in other languages. The resulting software did things our competitors&#8217; software couldn&#8217;t do. Maybe there was some kind of connection. I encourage you to follow that thread. There may be more to that old man hobbling along on his crutches than meets the eye.</p>

<p>Aikido for Startups</p>

<p>But I don&#8217;t expect to convince anyone (over 25) to go out and learn Lisp. The purpose of this article is not to change anyone&#8217;s mind, but to reassure people already interested in using Lisp&#8211; people who know that Lisp is a powerful language, but worry because it isn&#8217;t widely used. In a competitive situation, that&#8217;s an advantage. Lisp&#8217;s power is multiplied by the fact that your competitors don&#8217;t get it.</p>

<p>If you think of using Lisp in a startup, you shouldn&#8217;t worry that it isn&#8217;t widely understood. You should hope that it stays that way. And it&#8217;s likely to. It&#8217;s the nature of programming languages to make most people satisfied with whatever they currently use. Computer hardware changes so much faster than personal habits that programming practice is usually ten to twenty years behind the processor. At places like MIT they were writing programs in high-level languages in the early 1960s, but many companies continued to write code in machine language well into the 1980s. I bet a lot of people continued to write machine language until the processor, like a bartender eager to close up and go home, finally kicked them out by switching to a risc instruction set.</p>

<p>Ordinarily technology changes fast. But programming languages are different: programming languages are not just technology, but what programmers think in. They&#8217;re half technology and half religion.[6] And so the median language, meaning whatever language the median programmer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg. Garbage collection, introduced by Lisp in about 1960, is now widely considered to be a good thing. Runtime typing, ditto, is growing in popularity. Lexical closures, introduced by Lisp in the early 1970s, are now, just barely, on the radar screen. Macros, introduced by Lisp in the mid 1960s, are still terra incognita.</p>

<p>Obviously, the median language has enormous momentum. I&#8217;m not proposing that you can fight this powerful force. What I&#8217;m proposing is exactly the opposite: that, like a practitioner of Aikido, you can use it against your opponents.</p>

<p>If you work for a big company, this may not be easy. You will have a hard time convincing the pointy-haired boss to let you build things in Lisp, when he has just read in the paper that some other language is poised, like Ada was twenty years ago, to take over the world. But if you work for a startup that doesn&#8217;t have pointy-haired bosses yet, you can, like we did, turn the Blub paradox to your advantage: you can use technology that your competitors, glued immovably to the median language, will never be able to match.</p>

<p>If you ever do find yourself working for a startup, here&#8217;s a handy tip for evaluating competitors. Read their job listings. Everything else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent, but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or they&#8217;ll get the wrong candidates.</p>

<p>During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions. A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month or so. The first thing I would do, after checking to see if they had a live online demo, was look at their job listings. After a couple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about and which not to. The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions had, the less dangerous the company was. The safest kind were the ones that wanted Oracle experience. You never had to worry about those. You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java developers. If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening&#8211; that&#8217;s starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers. If I had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would have been really worried.</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>[1] Viaweb at first had two parts: the editor, written in Lisp, which people used to build their sites, and the ordering system, written in C, which handled orders. The first version was mostly Lisp, because the ordering system was small. Later we added two more modules, an image generator written in C, and a back-office manager written mostly in Perl.</p>

<p>In January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor written in C++ and Perl. It&#8217;s hard to say whether the program is no longer written in Lisp, though, because to translate this program into C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source files of all the page-generating templates are still, as far as I know, Lisp code. (See Greenspun&#8217;s Tenth Rule.)</p>

<p>[2] Robert Morris says that I didn&#8217;t need to be secretive, because even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn&#8217;t have understood why: &#8220;If they were that smart they&#8217;d already be programming in Lisp.&#8221;</p>

<p>[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing equivalent, but that&#8217;s not the sense of the word programmers care about. (No one wants to program a Turing machine.) The kind of power programmers care about may not be formally definable, but one way to explain it would be to say that it refers to features you could only get in the less powerful language by writing an interpreter for the more powerful language in it. If language A has an operator for removing spaces from strings and language B doesn&#8217;t, that probably doesn&#8217;t make A more powerful, because you can probably write a subroutine to do it in B. But if A supports, say, recursion, and B doesn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s not likely to be something you can fix by writing library functions.</p>

<p>[4] Note to nerds: or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top; it&#8217;s not the shape that matters here but the idea that there is at least a partial order.</p>

<p>[5] It is a bit misleading to treat macros as a separate feature. In practice their usefulness is greatly enhanced by other Lisp features like lexical closures and rest parameters.</p>

<p>[6] As a result, comparisons of programming languages either take the form of religious wars or undergraduate textbooks so determinedly neutral that they&#8217;re really works of anthropology. People who value their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic. But the question is only half a religious one; there is something there worth studying, especially if you want to design new languages.</p>
