  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.paulgrahamcn.com/article/really">创业究竟是神马</a></p>

<p>我并不清楚对创业学校有什么要说的。所以我决定问问我们所资助的这些创业者，还有什么是我没有写过的？</p>

<p>我正处在一个不同寻常的位置，让我恰好可以来验证我所写的关于创业的那些文章。我希望我在其他话题上所写的文章也是正确的，可是我没有办法验证他们。但我写的关于创业的文章则每6个月就能被大约70人所验证。</p>

<p>所以我给每个创业者发了一份电子邮件，问他们在进行一次创业的过程中，什么最令他们感到意外？这么多人问我是不是哪里搞错了，因为如果我把每件事都解释清楚了，应该没有什么能让他们感到意外的。</p>

<p>我很自豪地告诉你们我收到这样一份回复：</p>

<p>最令我吃惊的是几乎所有的事情都能被准确的预计到。</p>

<p>但坏消息是我收到其他100多份回复列出了他们所遇到的惊喜。</p>

<p>这些回复都有非常相同的模式；很明显的，人们总是被相同的事实所惊讶道。以下是它们中最常见的。</p>

<p>1.小心你的合伙人</p>

<p>这一条被最多创业者提到。通常有两种反馈：你需要小心挑选你的合伙人，并且你需要努力维持你们之间的伙伴关系。</p>

<p>当人们选择合伙人时，他们总是希望花更多的时间在人品和性格上，而不是能力。而那些失败的创业案例中尤其能体现出这一点。从中我们能得到的教训就是：永远不要选那些会半途离开的人作为合伙人。</p>

<p>这里有个典型的回复：</p>

<p>只有当你和一个人一起创业后你才能看出一个人真正的面目。为什么说人品是那么重要呢，因为在创业这个环境中比其他任何环境都更能测试人性。一位创业者曾明确的说过，创业者之间的关系比能力更为重要：</p>

<p>我宁可和一个朋友创业，也不要和一个能力很强的陌生人合伙。创业是如此的艰难而又情绪化的一个事情，友谊所带来的感情的纽带和社交的支持足以弥补能力上的差异。</p>

<p>我们很早已经就意识到这一点了。如果你看看那些风投申请书你会发现，其中关于合伙人之间信任以及相互关系的问题要比他们能力的问题多得多。</p>

<p>在那些成功的创业案例中，创业者很少谈如何选择合伙人，而是更多的谈论如何努力维持他们之间的良好关系。</p>

<p>其中有件事让我很意外，那就是创业伙伴之间的关系如何从朋友进而成为夫妻。我和我合伙人的关系在最初的时候仅仅是每时每刻都会看得到的朋友而已，一起担忧公司的财务状况，一起清理垃圾，公司就像我们孩子一样。我曾经这样总结道：“这就像我们虽然已经结婚了但却没有做爱。”</p>

<p>很多人都用结婚这个词，创业者之间的关系要比你通常看到的同事之间的关系更为紧密。部分原因是因为两者之间，所承受的要压力，差得很多，而另一部分原因则是在最初的时候创业者就是公司的全部了。所以它们之间的关系式建立在物质之上而且小心的维系着的。这是一切的基础。</p>

<p>2.创业将会成为你生活的全部</p>

<p>就像创业者之间的感情要比普通同事之间的感情更紧密一样，创业者和公司之间的关系也更为紧密。创业并不像打工或者上学那样，因为一旦你开始了就再也停不下来了。其中经历对大多数人来说太过于陌生以至于直到事情发生了他们才意识到。</p>

<p>我当初并没有意识到我会将工作时间的每一分每一秒都花在创业上。当你的公司在和别人的公司PK时，你就会进入一个完全不同的生活方式。而这一情况也会因为创业阶段快速的生活节奏而愈演愈烈，甚至时间看上去都变慢了。</p>

<p>我认为最令我意外的事情就是一个人通过创业，他对时间的看法会发生很大的变化。就拿我的创业来讲吧，我记得时间看上去就像在慢慢蠕动，一个月对我来说就是很长一段时间了。</p>

<p>在最好的案例中，甚至存在达到忘我境界的人。连你自己也会对你沉浸其中的程度感到吃惊，你会不分日夜的考虑工作的事情，但却一点也不觉得是在工作。</p>

<p>虽然我不得不说明，这引用了我们今年夏天资助的一位创业着的讲话。再过几年也许他就没法那么高兴了。</p>

<p>3.这是一个大悲大喜的事</p>

<p>还有一个事也让很多人感到惊讶，情绪的波动要比他们预想的极端得多。</p>

<p>在创业中，事情一会看上去很完美，而下一刻又让人感觉毫无希望。这里的下一刻我指的是几个小时之后。对我来说情绪的波动是最大的意外。头一天我可能还想象自己的公司是下一个谷歌，做梦想着买小岛；之后又在想怎么和我们所爱的人说出自己即将到来失败。就这样不停的循环。</p>

<p>很明显的，最难熬过去的是那些失落的时候。对很多创业者来说如何在困难的日子里激励每一个人，是最大的挑战。比如，在经过一段时间后，如果你不能取得一些成功来激励你自己，那么失败就会将你淘汰出局。</p>

<p>我对创业者最基本的建议是“不要死”，但维持一个公司在困境中生存下去的能量并不是无穷无境的。这些能量都是从创业者身上压出来的。</p>

<p>你能承受的压力总是有个极限的。如果你达到了你的极限，那么你就不能再做更多的事了。但这并不是世界末日，很多著名的创业者在他们的创业路途上都曾经有过几次失败的经历。</p>

<p>4.创业可能很有意思</p>

<p>好消息是，在你情绪高潮的时候也的确是非常的快乐。几位创业者说最令他们吃惊的是创业居然可以如此有趣：</p>

<p>我想你可能忽略了创业是多么有趣这一事实。我比我任何一个没有创业的朋友都更能从工作中得到满足感。</p>

<p>而这些创业者最喜欢的是工作的自由性：</p>

<p>我最惊讶的是在与之前所做的那种普通雇员时相比，做一份如此有挑战性，创造性以及我所认同的工作，我会感觉如此良好。</p>

<p>坦白来说，如果我在这里误导了人们，那么我宁愿不去修改这个错误。我宁可人人都觉得创业是一项无聊且困难的工作，而不是让他们抱着一种有趣的期望来创业。因为几个月后，他们会说“这应该是有趣的？你在开玩笑么？”</p>

<p>事实是，对大多数人来说创业并不有趣。我们在申请程序中所极力想要做的，就是剔除那些不喜欢创业的人，不管是因为我们的原因还是他自己的原因使得他不喜欢。</p>

<p>最好的方式来看待这个问题可能是这样的：如果你沉浸到创业中，那么开始一次创业是有趣的，一次生存训练课程是有趣的。换句话说，如果你没有沉浸其中，那么它一点都不有趣。</p>

<p>5.坚持是关键</p>

<p>很多创业者对坚持在创业中的重要程度而感到惊讶。这既是一个正面的也是一个负面的意外。</p>

<p>每个人都说你需要下多大的决心，需要多大的弹性。但经历过这一切以后，我意识到，这些所宣称的程度还远远不够。</p>

<p>并且关于坚持能解决什么程度的问题：如果你坚持不懈，那么即使是你无法控制的问题，例如，移民问题，也能够迎刃而解。</p>

<p>几位创业者都提到了，坚持要比聪明重要得多。</p>

<p>而我呢，我一次又一次的意识到坚持比智力要重要得太多太多。 一般来说，在申请中这里指的不仅仅是智力也包括能力，这也是为什么很多人说个性在选择合伙人中最重要。</p>

<p>6.眼光要远</p>

<p>你需要坚持，因为所有的事都会花费比你预想的更多的时间。很多人则对此感到意外</p>

<p>就我自己而言，总是频繁地对每件事能花费那么多时间而感到意外。假设你的产品并没有像极个别产品那样发生爆炸性的增长。所有的事，从开发到销售（尤其是销售）看上去比你预期的要多花2到3倍的时间。</p>

<p>创业者对此感到意外的原因之一是他们自己工作得很快，他们希望其他人也能有这种速度。当一个创业公司接触到一个多分枝的组织，例如一个大公司和一个风投基金的时候，就有很大数量的公司被淘汰出局。这就是为什么很多集资和企业加市场扼杀了那么多创业公司的原因。</p>

<p>但我认为绝大多数创业者感到意外的原因是因为他们过于自信了。他们认为他们会像YouTube 和facebook一样马上就会取得成功。如果你告诉他们只有百分之一的创业企业能有那样的发展轨迹，那么他们会告诉你“我们就要成为那百分之一”</p>

<p>可能他们会愿意听听最成功的创业者之一：在我开始创业之前最让我不明白的事情就是，坚持到底是这场游戏的全部。对大多数成功的创业者来说，这是一个漫长的过程，最少也要3年而一般来说都要5年以上。</p>

<p>当然长期的考虑问题也有它积极的一面。你并不需要不停的修改重新设定你的计划，使每件事都花费更多的时间。如果你耐心地工作，那么你就不会那么有压力，也就能更好的完成工作。</p>

<p>因为在放松的情况下，我们就更容易从工作中获得乐趣。失败就是笨拙紧张能量的聚合，而这些能量则是由不能失败的绝望的需求产生的。我们应该把注意力放在怎样为我们的产品，公司，职员和客户做到最好。</p>

<p>这就是为什么当你达到你的预期收益率时，你会觉得一切都变得更顺利了，你会进入一种完全不同的工作模式。</p>

<p>7.很多琐碎的事情</p>

<p>我们常常强调很少有创业公司仅仅因为他们有一个很好的创意就获得成功的。我认为创业者现在就应该把这个刻进他们的脑子里。很多人创业以后才发现在创业中这条也是适用的。你必须做很多不同的事情：</p>

<p>与其说创业是一个富有吸引力的事不如说是件苦差事。如果你随机的挑个时间来找我，那我很有可能在在处理瑞典语windows中一个奇怪的DLL文件加载问题，或者在董事会的前一夜，处理EXCEL表单中金融模型的一个错误，而不是突然有一个公司策略的好主意。</p>

<p>绝大多数的IT创业者希望把他们所有的时间用在编写程序上。事实上你不可能做到这样，除非你的创业失败了。换句话说：如果你把你所有的时间都用在编程上， 你必定会失败。</p>

<p>当然，这条定律并不仅仅针对编程。很少有仅仅是一个聪明的程序员就能保证创业的成功：</p>

<p>我从我的经历中学到一点，永远不要将创业的成功赌在一个人的特长，一笔交易或者任何类似的东西上。创业从来就不是由一件事决定的。每件事对其都有所助益，而你要做的就是不停的做各种各样的事直到你达到一定程度。</p>

<p>即使在那些极少数案例中，因为一个出色的程序员而获得成功。你也不太可能在事前就知道。事实上根本就没有所谓的决定性的一点。或者至少你事先不会知道是哪一点。</p>

<p>所以最好的策略就是尝试很多不同的事情。不要把鸡蛋放在同一个篮子里，这个道理并不那么简单，即使在你知道哪个篮子是最好的，的情况下它也仍然适用，更何况在创业中你并不知道哪个是最好的。</p>

<p>8.从小事做起</p>

<p>很多创业者都提到要从最容易成功的事做起。到了这个时候，每个人都知道应该不断地快速发布产品。在我们风投行业更是如此。但依然有很多人因为没有这么做而被淘汰。完成一件最小的事也可以被认为是一次完整的应用然后把它装箱送出去。</p>

<p>为什么人们总是在第一版的时候花费那么多时间呢？主要是因为自豪，他们不愿意在还能有所改进的时候就把产品发布到市场上。他们担心人们可能会指责这些缺陷。但你必须克服这样的心理。在一开始做一些简单的事情，并不意味着你没有做有意义的，可辩解的或者有价值的事情。不要担心人么会讲什么。如果你的第一版做得很完美，那么改进它就会变得毫无乐趣。你会等得太久而无法发布你的产品。</p>

<p>一位创业者说对任何项目来说都应该遵循这一原则，并不仅仅是创业的时候。对此我也深有同感。</p>

<p>现在，当我在编程的时候，我努力想：“我怎么能写这样的程序呢，如果人们看到的话，会为其只有那么小而感到惊讶。”</p>

<p>过度设计对产品来说就是一剂毒药。这不像你为额外的信用而做额外的工作。这更像是你说了个慌，然后你不得不记住它，防止你自相矛盾。</p>

<p>9.使用户参与其中</p>

<p>产品开发就是一场与用户的对话，而通常这一过程并不会发生，直到你发布产品。在发布产品之前，你就像一个在把他第一稿的素描给目击人看之前的警察局的拼图师。</p>

<p>快速的发布产品是如此的重要以至于你可以考虑不要将你的第一版作为一个产品，而是作为一个引起用户谈论，关注的策略。</p>

<p>我从中学到，要把创业的初始阶段看做是一场巨大的实验。所有的产品都应该被纳入试验中。那些有市场的产品很快就会达到预期的结果。一旦你开始你与用户的对话，你会为他们和你说的感到意外。</p>

<p>当你让顾客告诉你他们在追逐什么的时候，他们通常会揭示出一些惊人的细节，这些是他们觉得有意义的，同时也是他们愿意付钱的部分。</p>

<p>当然这些意外既有正面的也有负面的。他们可能和你所预想的完全不同，但有些也可能很容易就能加入你原有的设计。只有当你通过发布一个错误的东西开始和客户的对话，他们才能表达出（或者意识到）什么是他们所盼望的。</p>

<p>10.改变你的想法</p>

<p>为了能从顾客参与的产品开发中获益，你必须愿意修改你的想法。我们常常鼓励创业者把创业的主意当做是一个假设而不是一个蓝图。但人们依然对做出改变后带来的好处感到惊讶。通常来说当你抱怨一件事很困难的时候，一般的建议就是更努力地工作。而在一个创业中，我认为你应该找出一个容易解决的问题。在答案中不断寻找完美的解决方案是我们所熟悉的。但如果你在问题的范围里多做点思考的话你会有巨大的收获。</p>

<p>但如果只有决心没有灵活变通的能力的话，创业只对你只能是一个贪婪的过程，然后得到一个不好不坏的结果。</p>

<p>当一个人下定决心以后，他仍然有走上一条又长又困难的不归路的风险。你想要有所进展，但在同时却不停的徘徊、游荡寻找一条最有希望的路。有一位创业者用非常简洁的语言归纳了这点：</p>

<p>现在我再也不会嘲笑别人的想法了，因为我意识到我分别一个主意是好是坏的能力太差了。</p>

<p>你永远不知道什么是行得通的。你只要在每一点上尽量做得最好就可以了。在YC中我们也执行这一条。我们依然不知道一个想法是否可行，但它看上去就像一连串的假设。</p>

<p>11.不要担心有竞争者</p>

<p>当你觉得你有一个很棒的想法时，这就像是对什么事有所愧疚一样。人们所做的就是看你的笑话，然后你就会想：“啊，他们知道”</p>

<p>这些警告几乎总是错的：那些你第一眼看上去像是你竞争对手的公司通常在你仔细研究后会发现他们并不是。即使他们和你的公司在相同领域里，但你们有着不同的目标。</p>

<p>人们对竞争反应过度的原因之一就是人们对创意的价值过分高估了。如果创意真的是成功的关键，那么有着相同创意的竞争者就会是一个真正的威胁。不过通常是执行力影响了最后的结果。：</p>

<p>所有的恐惧，包括对一个新竞争对手的出现的都会在几周后被遗忘。最终你还是要回到你的产品上，然后将它发布到市场中。通常情况下这一条都是适用的，即使竞争对手获得了很多的关注。</p>

<p>那些在博客排行榜上停留在前列的竞争者很少会成为最终的赢家，而且可能很快就从人么的视线中消失了。你所需要的最终也只是消费者而已，大肆宣传并不会带来满意的用户，至少对这么复杂的技术类产品商品不会。</p>

<p>12.争取用户很困难</p>

<p>很多创业者抱怨为了争取客户有多么困难。我也不知道吸引用户需要花费多少精力和时间。这是一个复杂的问题。当你没有用户的时候，很难说是否是缺乏宣传，或者仅仅是产品不够好。即使是好产品也可能因为置换成本和整合成本而不受欢迎。</p>

<p>让人们开始使用一种全新的服务更是困难重重。这一点对那种其他公司也能提供的服务尤其困难，因为这要求它的开发商做更多的工作。如果你是很小的公司，那么他们不会觉得这是很紧急的事情。我们在YC面临的最尖锐的危机，正如我们的一位创业者所说的那样，不够专注于客户的获取。YC鼓励的是“做客户想要的东西”的理念，不断的改进一个又一个产品特性，直到有足够人感到满意或者产品下架为止。我们很少关注在客户获取方面的花费。</p>

<p>这可能很严重；这可能是我们需要改进的地方，尤其对于游戏这一类的软件来说。如果你只是在技术上做一些有挑战的东西。那么你可以靠口口相传来争取你的用户，就像谷歌那样。一位创业者对这样做所取得的良好效果而感到意外：</p>

<p>在创业的过程中你可能会产生一种非理性的恐惧，担心人们不会买你的产品。但如果你努力工作并不断完善你的产品，那么这完全是一种多余的担忧。</p>

<p>但对其他类型的创业来说，关注交易和市场营销要比关注于产品更能给你带来成功。</p>

<p>13.在交易中做最坏的打算</p>

<p>生意失败。这是创业中的常事。创业总是很无力的，而好的创意看上去总是错的。所以每个人总是迫不及待地想要结束和你的交易，而你没办法改变他们。</p>

<p>对投资者来说尤其是这样：</p>

<p>回头来看，如果我们当初能以没有任何外部投资的假设去进行我们的创业的话，我们将会取得更大的成功。这样做会使我们更加专注于寻找利润来源。</p>

<p>关于这一点我的建议是尽量保持悲观。假设你自己不会得到任何投资，即使你得到了一些投资，假设你不会再有更多的投资。</p>

<p>如果一个人向你投资，那么接受它。你会谈论很多，但我觉得 你需要更重视它。去年我们曾有机会募集到比我们实际募集到的金额多得多钱。我真希望我们当时能抓住机会。</p>

<p>为什么创业者往往会忽视这一点？主要是因为他们天生就是乐观主义者。而错就错在你不该对不在你掌控中的事乐观。你可以对的产品和你的能力尽一切可能的保持乐观，但如果你对大公司或者投资人保持乐观的话，那么你只是自讨苦吃而已。</p>

<p>14.投资人都是无知的</p>

<p>很多创业者都提到当他们意识到投资者是无知的时候有多惊讶。</p>

<p>他们甚至都不了解他们所投资的东西到底是什么东西。我遇到过一些投资同一家硬件厂商的投资者，当我要求他们演示一下他们的产品时，他们居然连开关都有困难。</p>

<p>天使投资在这方面要比风险投资要好一点，至少他们还是有创业的经历的。</p>

<p>风投对他们所谈论的东西有一半以上是不懂的。而且他们的思想也远远落后于时代。只有一些是很好的，而我们所接触到的剩下的95%都是不专业的，看上去就不像是个做生意的料以及任何创造性的眼光。天使投资在这方面更值得交流。</p>

<p>为什么创业者对投资人的无知会感到意外呢？我认为是因为在创业者眼中，投资人的形象是如此高大。</p>

<p>而投资人看上去高大又是因为他们的专长就是如此。他们必须让资产经理信任他们，把几亿美元都委托给他们。如果是你你要怎么做？你必须显得很有自信，显得你很懂技术的样子。</p>

<p>15.你可能不得不耍些小手段</p>

<p>因为投资人在看人的时候太不准了。所以你不得不更加努力的推销你自己。一个创业者所说的最令他意外的经历是：你装的越自信，投资人就印象越好</p>

<p>在YC创业者经历中这是最令我意外的了。这个夏天我们邀请了一些校友来和新学员一起讨论资金募集。几乎100%他们给的意见都是关于投资者心理学的。我以前一直认为我对投资者已经都敷衍了。但这些创业者则更加敷衍，很多创业者所做的仅仅只是装装样子而已，但它的确管用。</p>

<p>风投自己并不知道他们所看中的那些创业者有多善于推销自己。而这又恰恰是我们在早先的阶段中所观察到的现象。风投通过在LP前装逼来拿到钱，创业者则在风投面前装逼来拿到钱。</p>

<p>16.运气是个很重要的因素</p>

<p>既然在创业者和钱之间的联系是如此的随机，那也就不应该奇怪运气在生意中式一个很重要的因素。但仍然有很多创业者对此感到意外。</p>

<p>我当时并没有意识到运气扮演了多重要的一个角色，以及它是多么的不可控。</p>

<p>如果你想想那些著名的创业公司，很明显运气都扮演了一个重要的角色。如果IBM坚持保有DOS系统的专利权，那么微软现在会在哪里呢？</p>

<p>为什么创业者会被这点所蒙蔽呢？生意人可能不会，但黑客们早就习惯了一个技术至上的世界，你得到你所应得的。当我们开始我们的创业的时候，我承载了我们夸张的梦想：这只是一场技术的竞争而已。从某种角度来说的确是这样。技术是有价值的，所以它们也是这样被定义的。但运气好才是决定性的因素。</p>

<p>准确来首，最好的模型会把一次创业的结局定义为技术，决心和运气的产物。无论你有多好的技巧，多大的决心，如果你的运气很差，那么结局也必然是失败的。</p>

<p>这些话并不是那些失败的创业者说的。那些很快就失败的创业者都倾向于责怪他们自己。而那些很快就获得成功的人也不会意识到它们自己是多幸运。处在两者之间的人则刚刚好能看清运气的重要性。</p>

<p>17.社区的价值</p>

<p>有惊人数量的创业者提高了社区的价值。一些指的是YC学员这个小圈子：</p>

<p>YC同辈学员之间的巨大价值，它们会在差不多相同的时间遇到相同的困难。但这并不应该让人感到意外，因为它就是这样被构建的。而其他人则在更大的范围内上感受创业社区的价值。住在硅谷有多大优势？在那里你会不断听到所有尖端的科学技术和创业消息，以及马上和有用的人面对面交流。而最令他们意外的是创业者之间普遍的慈善精神。</p>

<p>我所看到最令我意外的就是人们都愿意帮助我们。即使他们不能从中得到些什么，他们还是会抽出时间帮我们获得成功。</p>

<p>尤其是这一点如何无时无刻的伸展在你生活的每一处：</p>

<p>最令我意外就是接触重要和有趣的人有多容易。你很容易就能和他们碰到然后马上得到反馈。这也是我选择成为他们中一员的原因。创造财富并不是一场零和博弈，所以你不需要把人家拉下来，以确保自己的胜利。</p>

<p>18.你得不到尊重</p>

<p>有一个创业者提出的意外是我宁可忘记的：在创业者的世界之外，创业者不会得到任何尊敬。</p>

<p>在我们的社会设定中，我发现如果我说我在微软工作，会比说我在一家叫X的新创业的企业工作获得更多的尊敬。</p>

<p>一部分是因为剩下的人并不创业，而另一部分原因是因为绝大多数的好的创业的想法看上去就很坏。</p>

<p>如果你随机的向一个路人宣传你的想法，95%的人凭直觉会认为你的创意会失败，而你只是在浪费时间而已（虽然他们并不一定会那么直接的说出来）。</p>

<p>不幸的是，这甚至蔓延到约会上了：</p>

<p>让我感到意外的是，作为一个创业者并不能从女人那里获得更多的青睐。</p>

<p>我的确知道这一点，但我宁可忘记它。</p>

<p>19.你的事业和你一起在成长</p>

<p>创业者们提到的最后一个意外就是，事情会随着你的成长而发生翻天覆地的变化。最大的改变就是你会做更少的编程工作。</p>

<p>你作为一个技术型创业者或者CEO的角色，每6到12个月就会被重新定义一次。你将花更少的时间在编程上，花更多的时间在管理，计划，公司建设，人事，处理杂事以及在事情发生几个月前就安排好相关的事务。</p>

<p>尤其是你现在需要开始和不同的员工打交道，而他们往往各自抱着不同的动机。</p>

<p>我知道作为一个创业者需要关注什么方面，并且从我19岁想要创业的时候就已经开始关注了。但和一个雇员需要关注的东西是非常不同的，而这花了我一些时间来适应。幸运的是，在熟悉这些以后，你就不会觉得压力那么大了：</p>

<p>和最初开始创业的时候相比，现在我们所承受的压力只有当初的25%。现在经营一个公司变得越来越有趣。我们熬夜奋战的次数少了，我们睡眠的时间多了。</p>

<p>我希望我能够说所有成功的创业都是这样的，但75%的都是始终处在很大的压力之下的。</p>

<p>超级模式</p>

<p>当然还存在着许多其他的模式，但是这些是最重要的。任何一个人第一眼看到这些的时候都是问这是不是一个超级模式，模式中的模式。</p>

<p>我马上就意识到了这一点，同时我读给一位YC的创立者听，他也马上意识到了。如果这些都是我没有告诉过人们的话，这些的确可以是一种意外。但他们之间都有一些共通点，他们都是我曾经说过的。如果我用相同的大纲写一篇新的文章，那不会是一篇对创业者反馈的总结，每个人都会说我已经才思枯竭，并且在重复自己的东西而已。</p>

<p>然后呢？</p>

<p>当我看到这些回复的时候，通常的主题都是说创业绝大部分都像我所说的那样，但远不仅仅是那样。所以人们知道自己亲身去做才知道创业有多困难。为什么会这样呢？问题的关键就在于要问，和什么相比创业是困难的。一旦你开始这样想以后，答案就很明显了：和打工相比。每个人对工作的概念一开始都是打工。这一条是非常普遍的。即使你从来没有打过工，你的爸妈可能打过，即使他们也没有，你成长道路上遇到的每个成年人都可能打过。</p>

<p>无形中，人们就对创业抱有一种打工的期望，这就解释了绝大部分的意外。这一条解释了为什么人们对要多么仔细挑选合伙人，多努力去维持你们的关系而感到意外了。在同事之间你就不需要这样做。它也解释了为什么人们对情绪的波动感到极端的意外。在打工过程中，生活总是显得很沉闷。这也解释了为什么好的时候感觉会那么棒：大多数的人都无法想象这种自由。当你浏览这份列表的时候，几乎所有的意外都是对于创业和打工之间的区别的。</p>

<p>你似乎不能轻易的改变一些如此普遍而又随着你的成长不断加深的关于工作的期望。所以最好的解决办法就是不断有意识的提醒自己。当你走进创业的世界的时，你会觉得每个人讲的都很极端。然后你的下一个想法就是“但我不相信事情会那么差。”如果你想要避免被惊讶到，那么你下一个想法就应该是：“我不能相信事情会变得那么差是因为我对工作的期望是打工。”</p>

<p>===============================</p>

<p>What Startups Are Really Like</p>

<p>October 2009</p>

<p>(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2009 Startup School.)</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure what to talk about at Startup School, so I decided to ask the founders of the startups we&#8217;d funded. What hadn&#8217;t I written about yet?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in the unusual position of being able to test the essays I write about startups. I hope the ones on other topics are right, but I have no way to test them. The ones on startups get tested by about 70 people every 6 months.</p>

<p>So I sent all the founders an email asking what surprised them about starting a startup. This amounts to asking what I got wrong, because if I&#8217;d explained things well enough, nothing should have surprised them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m proud to report I got one response saying:</p>

<p>What surprised me the most is that everything was actually fairly predictable!</p>

<p>The bad news is that I got over 100 other responses listing the surprises they encountered.</p>

<p>There were very clear patterns in the responses; it was remarkable how often several people had been surprised by exactly the same thing. These were the biggest:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be Careful with Cofounders</li>
</ol>


<p>This was the surprise mentioned by the most founders. There were two types of responses: that you have to be careful who you pick as a cofounder, and that you have to work hard to maintain your relationship.</p>

<p>What people wished they&#8217;d paid more attention to when choosing cofounders was character and commitment, not ability. This was particularly true with startups that failed. The lesson: don&#8217;t pick cofounders who will flake.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a typical reponse:</p>

<p>You haven&#8217;t seen someone&#8217;s true colors unless you&#8217;ve worked with them on a startup.</p>

<p>The reason character is so important is that it&#8217;s tested more severely than in most other situations. One founder said explicitly that the relationship between founders was more important than ability:</p>

<p>I would rather cofound a startup with a friend than a stranger with higher output. Startups are so hard and emotional that the bonds and emotional and social support that come with friendship outweigh the extra output lost.</p>

<p>We learned this lesson a long time ago. If you look at the YC application, there are more questions about the commitment and relationship of the founders than their ability.</p>

<p>Founders of successful startups talked less about choosing cofounders and more about how hard they worked to maintain their relationship.</p>

<p>One thing that surprised me is how the relationship of startup founders goes from a friendship to a marriage. My relationship with my cofounder went from just being friends to seeing each other all the time, fretting over the finances and cleaning up shit. And the startup was our baby. I summed it up once like this: &#8220;It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re married, but we&#8217;re not fucking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several people used that word &#8220;married.&#8221; It&#8217;s a far more intense relationship than you usually see between coworkers—partly because the stresses are so much greater, and partly because at first the founders are the whole company. So this relationship has to be built of top quality materials and carefully maintained. It&#8217;s the basis of everything.</p>

<ol>
<li>Startups Take Over Your Life</li>
</ol>


<p>Just as the relationship between cofounders is more intense than it usually is between coworkers, so is the relationship between the founders and the company. Running a startup is not like having a job or being a student, because it never stops. This is so foreign to most people&#8217;s experience that they don&#8217;t get it till it happens. [1]</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t realize I would spend almost every waking moment either working or thinking about our startup. You enter a whole different way of life when it&#8217;s your company vs. working for someone else&#8217;s company.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s exacerbated by the fast pace of startups, which makes it seem like time slows down:</p>

<p>I think the thing that&#8217;s been most surprising to me is how one&#8217;s perspective on time shifts. Working on our startup, I remember time seeming to stretch out, so that a month was a huge interval.</p>

<p>In the best case, total immersion can be exciting:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s surprising how much you become consumed by your startup, in that you think about it day and night, but never once does it feel like &#8220;work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though I have to say, that quote is from someone we funded this summer. In a couple years he may not sound so chipper.</p>

<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s an Emotional Roller-coaster</li>
</ol>


<p>This was another one lots of people were surprised about. The ups and downs were more extreme than they were prepared for.</p>

<p>In a startup, things seem great one moment and hopeless the next. And by next, I mean a couple hours later.</p>

<p>The emotional ups and downs were the biggest surprise for me. One day, we&#8217;d think of ourselves as the next Google and dream of buying islands; the next, we&#8217;d be pondering how to let our loved ones know of our utter failure; and on and on.</p>

<p>The hard part, obviously, is the lows. For a lot of founders that was the big surprise:</p>

<p>How hard it is to keep everyone motivated during rough days or weeks, i.e. how low the lows can be.</p>

<p>After a while, if you don&#8217;t have significant success to cheer you up, it wears you out:</p>

<p>Your most basic advice to founders is &#8220;just don&#8217;t die,&#8221; but the energy to keep a company going in lieu of unburdening success isn&#8217;t free; it is siphoned from the founders themselves.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a limit to how much you can take. If you get to the point where you can&#8217;t keep working anymore, it&#8217;s not the end of the world. Plenty of famous founders have had some failures along the way.</p>

<ol>
<li>It Can Be Fun</li>
</ol>


<p>The good news is, the highs are also very high. Several founders said what surprised them most about doing a startup was how fun it was:</p>

<p>I think you&#8217;ve left out just how fun it is to do a startup. I am more fulfilled in my work than pretty much any of my friends who did not start companies.</p>

<p>What they like most is the freedom:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m surprised by how much better it feels to be working on something that is challenging and creative, something I believe in, as opposed to the hired-gun stuff I was doing before. I knew it would feel better; what&#8217;s surprising is how much better.</p>

<p>Frankly, though, if I&#8217;ve misled people here, I&#8217;m not eager to fix that. I&#8217;d rather have everyone think starting a startup is grim and hard than have founders go into it expecting it to be fun, and a few months later saying &#8220;This is supposed to be fun? Are you kidding?&#8221;</p>

<p>The truth is, it wouldn&#8217;t be fun for most people. A lot of what we try to do in the application process is to weed out the people who wouldn&#8217;t like it, both for our sake and theirs.</p>

<p>The best way to put it might be that starting a startup is fun the way a survivalist training course would be fun, if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing. Which is to say, not at all, if you&#8217;re not.</p>

<ol>
<li>Persistence Is the Key</li>
</ol>


<p>A lot of founders were surprised how important persistence was in startups. It was both a negative and a positive surprise: they were surprised both by the degree of persistence required</p>

<p>Everyone said how determined and resilient you must be, but going through it made me realize that the determination required was still understated.</p>

<p>and also by the degree to which persistence alone was able to dissolve obstacles:</p>

<p>If you are persistent, even problems that seem out of your control (i.e. immigration) seem to work themselves out.</p>

<p>Several founders mentioned specifically how much more important persistence was than intelligence.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been surprised again and again by just how much more important persistence is than raw intelligence.</p>

<p>This applies not just to intelligence but to ability in general, and that&#8217;s why so many people said character was more important in choosing cofounders.</p>

<ol>
<li>Think Long-Term</li>
</ol>


<p>You need persistence because everything takes longer than you expect. A lot of people were surprised by that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m continually surprised by how long everything can take. Assuming your product doesn&#8217;t experience the explosive growth that very few products do, everything from development to dealmaking (especially dealmaking) seems to take 2-3x longer than I always imagine.</p>

<p>One reason founders are surprised is that because they work fast, they expect everyone else to. There&#8217;s a shocking amount of shear stress at every point where a startup touches a more bureaucratic organization, like a big company or a VC fund. That&#8217;s why fundraising and the enterprise market kill and maim so many startups. [2]</p>

<p>But I think the reason most founders are surprised by how long it takes is that they&#8217;re overconfident. They think they&#8217;re going to be an instant success, like YouTube or Facebook. You tell them only 1 out of 100 successful startups has a trajectory like that, and they all think &#8220;we&#8217;re going to be that 1.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maybe they&#8217;ll listen to one of the more successful founders:</p>

<p>The top thing I didn&#8217;t understand before going into it is that persistence is the name of the game. For the vast majority of startups that become successful, it&#8217;s going to be a really long journey, at least 3 years and probably 5+.</p>

<p>There is a positive side to thinking longer-term. It&#8217;s not just that you have to resign yourself to everything taking longer than it should. If you work patiently it&#8217;s less stressful, and you can do better work:</p>

<p>Because we&#8217;re relaxed, it&#8217;s so much easier to have fun doing what we do. Gone is the awkward nervous energy fueled by the desperate need to not fail guiding our actions. We can concentrate on doing what&#8217;s best for our company, product, employees and customers.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why things get so much better when you hit ramen profitability. You can shift into a different mode of working.</p>

<ol>
<li>Lots of Little Things</li>
</ol>


<p>We often emphasize how rarely startups win simply because they hit on some magic idea. I think founders have now gotten that into their heads. But a lot were surprised to find this also applies within startups. You have to do lots of different things:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s much more of a grind than glamorous. A timeslice selected at random would more likely find me tracking down a weird DLL loading bug on Swedish Windows, or tracking down a bug in the financial model Excel spreadsheet the night before a board meeting, rather than having brilliant flashes of strategic insight.</p>

<p>Most hacker-founders would like to spend all their time programming. You won&#8217;t get to, unless you fail. Which can be transformed into: If you spend all your time programming, you will fail.</p>

<p>The principle extends even into programming. There is rarely a single brilliant hack that ensures success:</p>

<p>I learnt never to bet on any one feature or deal or anything to bring you success. It is never a single thing. Everything is just incremental and you just have to keep doing lots of those things until you strike something.</p>

<p>Even in the rare cases where a clever hack makes your fortune, you probably won&#8217;t know till later:</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a killer feature. Or at least you won&#8217;t know what it is.</p>

<p>So the best strategy is to try lots of different things. The reason not to put all your eggs in one basket is not the usual one, which applies even when you know which basket is best. In a startup you don&#8217;t even know that.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with Something Minimal</li>
</ol>


<p>Lots of founders mentioned how important it was to launch with the simplest possible thing. By this point everyone knows you should release fast and iterate. It&#8217;s practically a mantra at YC. But even so a lot of people seem to have been burned by not doing it:</p>

<p>Build the absolute smallest thing that can be considered a complete application and ship it.</p>

<p>Why do people take too long on the first version? Pride, mostly. They hate to release something that could be better. They worry what people will say about them. But you have to overcome this:</p>

<p>Doing something &#8220;simple&#8221; at first glance does not mean you aren&#8217;t doing something meaningful, defensible, or valuable.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry what people will say. If your first version is so impressive that trolls don&#8217;t make fun of it, you waited too long to launch. [3]</p>

<p>One founder said this should be your approach to all programming, not just startups, and I tend to agree.</p>

<p>Now, when coding, I try to think &#8220;How can I write this such that if people saw my code, they&#8217;d be amazed at how little there is and how little it does?&#8221;</p>

<p>Over-engineering is poison. It&#8217;s not like doing extra work for extra credit. It&#8217;s more like telling a lie that you then have to remember so you don&#8217;t contradict it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Engage Users</li>
</ol>


<p>Product development is a conversation with the user that doesn&#8217;t really start till you launch. Before you launch, you&#8217;re like a police artist before he&#8217;s shown the first version of his sketch to the witness.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s so important to launch fast that it may be better to think of your initial version not as a product, but as a trick for getting users to start talking to you.</p>

<p>I learned to think about the initial stages of a startup as a giant experiment. All products should be considered experiments, and those that have a market show promising results extremely quickly.</p>

<p>Once you start talking to users, I guarantee you&#8217;ll be surprised by what they tell you.</p>

<p>When you let customers tell you what they&#8217;re after, they will often reveal amazing details about what they find valuable as well what they&#8217;re willing to pay for.</p>

<p>The surprise is generally positive as well as negative. They won&#8217;t like what you&#8217;ve built, but there will be other things they would like that would be trivially easy to implement. It&#8217;s not till you start the conversation by launching the wrong thing that they can express (or perhaps even realize) what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>

<ol>
<li>Change Your Idea</li>
</ol>


<p>To benefit from engaging with users you have to be willing to change your idea. We&#8217;ve always encouraged founders to see a startup idea as a hypothesis rather than a blueprint. And yet they&#8217;re still surprised how well it works to change the idea.</p>

<p>Normally if you complain about something being hard, the general advice is to work harder. With a startup, I think you should find a problem that&#8217;s easy for you to solve. Optimizing in solution-space is familiar and straightforward, but you can make enormous gains playing around in problem-space.</p>

<p>Whereas mere determination, without flexibility, is a greedy algorithm that may get you nothing more than a mediocre local maximum:</p>

<p>When someone is determined, there&#8217;s still a danger that they&#8217;ll follow a long, hard path that ultimately leads nowhere.</p>

<p>You want to push forward, but at the same time twist and turn to find the most promising path. One founder put it very succinctly:</p>

<p>Fast iteration is the key to success.</p>

<p>One reason this advice is so hard to follow is that people don&#8217;t realize how hard it is to judge startup ideas, particularly their own. Experienced founders learn to keep an open mind:</p>

<p>Now I don&#8217;t laugh at ideas anymore, because I realized how terrible I was at knowing if they were good or not.</p>

<p>You can never tell what will work. You just have to do whatever seems best at each point. We do this with YC itself. We still don&#8217;t know if it will work, but it seems like a decent hypothesis.</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t Worry about Competitors</li>
</ol>


<p>When you think you&#8217;ve got a great idea, it&#8217;s sort of like having a guilty conscience about something. All someone has to do is look at you funny, and you think &#8220;Oh my God, they know.&#8221;</p>

<p>These alarms are almost always false:</p>

<p>Companies that seemed like competitors and threats at first glance usually never were when you really looked at it. Even if they were operating in the same area, they had a different goal.</p>

<p>One reason people overreact to competitors is that they overvalue ideas. If ideas really were the key, a competitor with the same idea would be a real threat. But it&#8217;s usually execution that matters:</p>

<p>All the scares induced by seeing a new competitor pop up are forgotten weeks later. It always comes down to your own product and approach to the market.</p>

<p>This is generally true even if competitors get lots of attention.</p>

<p>Competitors riding on lots of good blogger perception aren&#8217;t really the winners and can disappear from the map quickly. You need consumers after all.</p>

<p>Hype doesn&#8217;t make satisfied users, at least not for something as complicated as technology.</p>

<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s Hard to Get Users</li>
</ol>


<p>A lot of founders complained about how hard it was to get users, though.</p>

<p>I had no idea how much time and effort needed to go into attaining users.</p>

<p>This is a complicated topic. When you can&#8217;t get users, it&#8217;s hard to say whether the problem is lack of exposure, or whether the product&#8217;s simply bad. Even good products can be blocked by switching or integration costs:</p>

<p>Getting people to use a new service is incredibly difficult. This is especially true for a service that other companies can use, because it requires their developers to do work. If you&#8217;re small, they don&#8217;t think it is urgent. [4]</p>

<p>The sharpest criticism of YC came from a founder who said we didn&#8217;t focus enough on customer acquisition:</p>

<p>YC preaches &#8220;make something people want&#8221; as an engineering task, a never ending stream of feature after feature until enough people are happy and the application takes off. There&#8217;s very little focus on the cost of customer acquisition.</p>

<p>This may be true; this may be something we need to fix, especially for applications like games. If you make something where the challenges are mostly technical, you can rely on word of mouth, like Google did. One founder was surprised by how well that worked for him:</p>

<p>There is an irrational fear that no one will buy your product. But if you work hard and incrementally make it better, there is no need to worry.</p>

<p>But with other types of startups you may win less by features and more by deals and marketing.</p>

<ol>
<li>Expect the Worst with Deals</li>
</ol>


<p>Deals fall through. That&#8217;s a constant of the startup world. Startups are powerless, and good startup ideas generally seem wrong. So everyone is nervous about closing deals with you, and you have no way to make them.</p>

<p>This is particularly true with investors:</p>

<p>In retrospect, it would have been much better if we had operated under the assumption that we would never get any additional outside investment. That would have focused us on finding revenue streams early.</p>

<p>My advice is generally pessimistic. Assume you won&#8217;t get money, and if someone does offer you any, assume you&#8217;ll never get any more.</p>

<p>If someone offers you money, take it. You say it a lot, but I think it needs even more emphasizing. We had the opportunity to raise a lot more money than we did last year and I wish we had.</p>

<p>Why do founders ignore me? Mostly because they&#8217;re optimistic by nature. The mistake is to be optimistic about things you can&#8217;t control. By all means be optimistic about your ability to make something great. But you&#8217;re asking for trouble if you&#8217;re optimistic about big companies or investors.</p>

<ol>
<li>Investors Are Clueless</li>
</ol>


<p>A lot of founders mentioned how surprised they were by the cluelessness of investors:</p>

<p>They don&#8217;t even know about the stuff they&#8217;ve invested in. I met some investors that had invested in a hardware device and when I asked them to demo the device they had difficulty switching it on.</p>

<p>Angels are a bit better than VCs, because they usually have startup experience themselves:</p>

<p>VC investors don&#8217;t know half the time what they are talking about and are years behind in their thinking. A few were great, but 95% of the investors we dealt with were unprofessional, didn&#8217;t seem to be very good at business or have any kind of creative vision. Angels were generally much better to talk to.</p>

<p>Why are founders surprised that VCs are clueless? I think it&#8217;s because they seem so formidable.</p>

<p>The reason VCs seem formidable is that it&#8217;s their profession to. You get to be a VC by convincing asset managers to trust you with hundreds of millions of dollars. How do you do that? You have to seem confident, and you have to seem like you understand technology. [5]</p>

<ol>
<li>You May Have to Play Games</li>
</ol>


<p>Because investors are so bad at judging you, you have to work harder than you should at selling yourself. One founder said the thing that surprised him most was</p>

<p>The degree to which feigning certitude impressed investors.</p>

<p>This is the thing that has surprised me most about YC founders&#8217; experiences. This summer we invited some of the alumni to talk to the new startups about fundraising, and pretty much 100% of their advice was about investor psychology. I thought I was cynical about VCs, but the founders were much more cynical.</p>

<p>A lot of what startup founders do is just posturing. It works.</p>

<p>VCs themselves have no idea of the extent to which the startups they like are the ones that are best at selling themselves to VCs. [6] It&#8217;s exactly the same phenomenon we saw a step earlier. VCs get money by seeming confident to LPs, and founders get money by seeming confident to VCs.</p>

<ol>
<li>Luck Is a Big Factor</li>
</ol>


<p>With two such random linkages in the path between startups and money, it shouldn&#8217;t be surprising that luck is a big factor in deals. And yet a lot of founders are surprised by it.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t realize how much of a role luck plays and how much is outside of our control.</p>

<p>If you think about famous startups, it&#8217;s pretty clear how big a role luck plays. Where would Microsoft be if IBM insisted on an exclusive license for DOS?</p>

<p>Why are founders fooled by this? Business guys probably aren&#8217;t, but hackers are used to a world where skill is paramount, and you get what you deserve.</p>

<p>When we started our startup, I had bought the hype of the startup founder dream: that this is a game of skill. It is, in some ways. Having skill is valuable. So is being determined as all hell. But being lucky is the critical ingredient.</p>

<p>Actually the best model would be to say that the outcome is the product of skill, determination, and luck. No matter how much skill and determination you have, if you roll a zero for luck, the outcome is zero.</p>

<p>These quotes about luck are not from founders whose startups failed. Founders who fail quickly tend to blame themselves. Founders who succeed quickly don&#8217;t usually realize how lucky they were. It&#8217;s the ones in the middle who see how important luck is.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Value of Community</li>
</ol>


<p>A surprising number of founders said what surprised them most about starting a startup was the value of community. Some meant the micro-community of YC founders:</p>

<p>The immense value of the peer group of YC companies, and facing similar obstacles at similar times.</p>

<p>which shouldn&#8217;t be that surprising, because that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s structured that way. Others were surprised at the value of the startup community in the larger sense:</p>

<p>How advantageous it is to live in Silicon Valley, where you can&#8217;t help but hear all the cutting-edge tech and startup news, and run into useful people constantly.</p>

<p>The specific thing that surprised them most was the general spirit of benevolence:</p>

<p>One of the most surprising things I saw was the willingness of people to help us. Even people who had nothing to gain went out of their way to help our startup succeed.</p>

<p>and particularly how it extended all the way to the top:</p>

<p>The surprise for me was how accessible important and interesting people are. It&#8217;s amazing how easily you can reach out to people and get immediate feedback.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons I like being part of this world. Creating wealth is not a zero-sum game, so you don&#8217;t have to stab people in the back to win.</p>

<ol>
<li>You Get No Respect</li>
</ol>


<p>There was one surprise founders mentioned that I&#8217;d forgotten about: that outside the startup world, startup founders get no respect.</p>

<p>In social settings, I found that I got a lot more respect when I said, &#8220;I worked on Microsoft Office&#8221; instead of &#8220;I work at a small startup you&#8217;ve never heard of called x.&#8221;</p>

<p>Partly this is because the rest of the world just doesn&#8217;t get startups, and partly it&#8217;s yet another consequence of the fact that most good startup ideas seem bad:</p>

<p>If you pitch your idea to a random person, 95% of the time you&#8217;ll find the person instinctively thinks the idea will be a flop and you&#8217;re wasting your time (although they probably won&#8217;t say this directly).</p>

<p>Unfortunately this extends even to dating:</p>

<p>It surprised me that being a startup founder does not get you more admiration from women.</p>

<p>I did know about that, but I&#8217;d forgotten.</p>

<ol>
<li>Things Change as You Grow</li>
</ol>


<p>The last big surprise founders mentioned is how much things changed as they grew. The biggest change was that you got to program even less:</p>

<p>Your job description as technical founder/CEO is completely rewritten every 6-12 months. Less coding, more managing/planning/company building, hiring, cleaning up messes, and generally getting things in place for what needs to happen a few months from now.</p>

<p>In particular, you now have to deal with employees, who often have different motivations:</p>

<p>I knew the founder equation and had been focused on it since I knew I wanted to start a startup as a 19 year old. The employee equation is quite different so it took me a while to get it down.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it can become a lot less stressful once you reach cruising altitude:</p>

<p>I&#8217;d say 75% of the stress is gone now from when we first started. Running a business is so much more enjoyable now. We&#8217;re more confident. We&#8217;re more patient. We fight less. We sleep more.</p>

<p>I wish I could say it was this way for every startup that succeeded, but 75% is probably on the high side.</p>

<p>The Super-Pattern</p>

<p>There were a few other patterns, but these were the biggest. One&#8217;s first thought when looking at them all is to ask if there&#8217;s a super-pattern, a pattern to the patterns.</p>

<p>I saw it immediately, and so did a YC founder I read the list to. These are supposed to be the surprises, the things I didn&#8217;t tell people. What do they all have in common? They&#8217;re all things I tell people. If I wrote a new essay with the same outline as this that wasn&#8217;t summarizing the founders&#8217; responses, everyone would say I&#8217;d run out of ideas and was just repeating myself.</p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>

<p>When I look at the responses, the common theme is that starting a startup was like I said, but way more so. People just don&#8217;t seem to get how different it is till they do it. Why? The key to that mystery is to ask, how different from what? Once you phrase it that way, the answer is obvious: from a job. Everyone&#8217;s model of work is a job. It&#8217;s completely pervasive. Even if you&#8217;ve never had a job, your parents probably did, along with practically every other adult you&#8217;ve met.</p>

<p>Unconsciously, everyone expects a startup to be like a job, and that explains most of the surprises. It explains why people are surprised how carefully you have to choose cofounders and how hard you have to work to maintain your relationship. You don&#8217;t have to do that with coworkers. It explains why the ups and downs are surprisingly extreme. In a job there is much more damping. But it also explains why the good times are surprisingly good: most people can&#8217;t imagine such freedom. As you go down the list, almost all the surprises are surprising in how much a startup differs from a job.</p>

<p>You probably can&#8217;t overcome anything so pervasive as the model of work you grew up with. So the best solution is to be consciously aware of that. As you go into a startup, you&#8217;ll be thinking &#8220;everyone says it&#8217;s really extreme.&#8221; Your next thought will probably be &#8220;but I can&#8217;t believe it will be that bad.&#8221; If you want to avoid being surprised, the next thought after that should be: &#8220;and the reason I can&#8217;t believe it will be that bad is that my model of work is a job.&#8221;</p>

<p>Notes</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.paulgrahamcn.com/article/selfindulgence">如何失去时间和金钱</a></p>

<p>2010年7月</p>

<p>1998年我们卖掉了自己的创业公司，突然间我有了很多钱。现在我不得不考虑一些以前从未考虑过的事情：如何避免失去这些钱。我知道人有可能由穷变富，也有可能由富变穷。过去几年我一直在研究由穷变富的方法，但我对如何由富变穷几乎一无所知。现在，为了避免由富变穷，我必须找出由富变穷的理由。</p>

<p>所以我开始注意财富是如何失去的。如果当我还是个孩子时你问我富人怎样才会变穷，我肯定会说把钱花掉。书里和电影里都是这些说的，因为这是最明显的方法。但实际上，大部分财富通常不是通过过度消费失去的，而是通过失败的投资。</p>

<p>你很难在毫不留意的情况下花掉一大笔钱。如果你花掉了几万块钱，很有可能会想“哇，我在花掉很多钱”。但如果你从事金融衍生品交易，一眨眼的工夫你就可能失去几百万美元（真的，你想赚多少就有可能赔多少）。</p>

<p>在大部分人看来，花钱购买奢侈品会给自己敲响警钟，而进行失败的投资则不会。买奢侈品看上去是自我放纵。除非你的钱是继承的家产或中彩票得来的，否则你已经很清楚自我放纵会带来麻烦。也正因为如此，很多人在向你推销奢侈品时会说“这是一笔投资”。</p>

<p>解决办法是建立新的警钟。这可能比较麻烦，因为阻止你过度消费的警钟非常基础，甚至它们有可能存在于我们的DNA里，而阻止你进行失败投资的警钟则需要学习，并且有时它们是非常违背直觉的。</p>

<p>几天前，我有一些惊人的发现：时间和金钱面临的情况非常类似。浪费时间最危险的办法不是花时间去享乐，而是花时间假装工作。当你花时间享乐时，你知道你在放纵自己。你的警钟很快就会敲响。如果我早上起来，坐在沙发上看一天电视，我会感到非常不舒服。想一想我都不寒而栗。坐在沙发上看两个小时的电视我都会感到不自在，更别说一整天了。</p>

<p>但我有时候的确会在电视前面坐一天，到一天结束的时候，如果我问自己当天做了什么，答案会是：几乎什么都没做。这样的一天过去后我也会不自在，但和坐在沙发上看一天电视那种感觉不一样。如果我看一整天电视，我会觉得我正在走向堕落。但是当我过完一事无成的一天之后，同样的警钟不会响起，因为从表面上看，我做的那些事情像是真正的工作，比如处理电子邮件。我坐在桌子旁边处理邮件，这并非享乐，那么这肯定是工作。</p>

<p>时间和金钱一样，避免享乐已经无法保护你。这种方法对于保护那些靠打猎采集为生的人或前工业化社会有用。先天因素和后天因素加在一起会让人们避开自我放纵。但是这个世界变得越来越复杂：现在最危险的陷阱是那些看似更加正经，从而可以绕开自我放纵警钟的新型行为。更糟糕的是，这些行为并不会带来乐趣。</p>

<p>================================</p>

<p>How To Lose Time And Money</p>

<p>July 2010</p>

<p>When we sold our startup in 1998 I suddenly got a lot of money. I now had to think about something I hadn&#8217;t had to think about before: how not to lose it. I knew it was possible to go from rich to poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich. But while I&#8217;d spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from poor to rich, I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich to poor. Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they were.</p>

<p>So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost. If you&#8217;d asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I&#8217;d have said by spending all their money. That&#8217;s how it happens in books and movies, because that&#8217;s the colorful way to do it. But in fact the way most fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through bad investments.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to spend a fortune without noticing. Someone with ordinary tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of thousands of dollars without thinking &#8220;wow, I&#8217;m spending a lot of money.&#8221; Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>In most people&#8217;s minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments doesn&#8217;t. Luxuries seem self-indulgent. And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery, you&#8217;ve already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads to trouble. Investing bypasses those alarms. You&#8217;re not spending the money; you&#8217;re just moving it from one asset to another. Which is why people trying to sell you expensive things say &#8220;it&#8217;s an investment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The solution is to develop new alarms. This can be a tricky business, because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes fairly counterintuitive.</p>

<p>A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with time is much the same as with money. The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work. When you spend time having fun, you know you&#8217;re being self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly. If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I&#8217;d feel like something was terribly wrong. Just thinking about it makes me wince. I&#8217;d start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.</p>

<p>And yet I&#8217;ve definitely had days when I might as well have sat in front of a TV all day—days at the end of which, if I asked myself what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically, nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad as I&#8217;d feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV. If I spent a whole day watching TV I&#8217;d feel like I was descending into perdition. But the same alarms don&#8217;t go off on the days when I get nothing done, because I&#8217;m doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work. Dealing with email, for example. You do it sitting at a desk. It&#8217;s not fun. So it must be work.</p>

<p>With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to protect you. It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers, and perhaps all pre-industrial societies. So nature and nurture combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more virtuous types. And the worst thing is, they&#8217;re not even fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.paulgrahamcn.com/article/start">如何开始创业</a></p>

<p>一次成功的创业建立在以下三个条件上：优秀的合伙人，确实有需求的产品，以及尽可能少的启动资金。绝大部分创业失败是因为它们缺少了以上这些条件中的某一项，而那些完全具备这三点的创业往往会取得成功。</p>

<p>让人欣慰的是，当你认真考虑它们的时候，这三点条件都是可行的，虽然可能有一点困难。鉴于成功的创业应该会让创始人富有，我们可以得出结论：富有的生活是可以实现的，只是有一点困难。</p>

<p>如果说在创业方面只有一点我想要澄清的话，那就是：创业时，并没有需要特别出众的才华才能踏出的，神奇的一步。</p>

<p>创意</p>

<p>特别需要指出的是，创业并不需要特别优秀的创意。创业的主旨是通过给人们提供比他们现在拥有的东西更好一点的商品，以次货的需求。可是很多人们现在拥有的产品和服务是如此之差，以至于不需要多聪明的头脑都能想出将之改善的方法。</p>

<p>以Google为例，开始时的计划仅仅是创造一个简单易用不至于烂得让人骂娘的搜索引擎。为此他们做了三点创新：链接更多网页，对搜索结果进行排序，以及使用不带骚扰广告的清新简洁的界面，因此总而言之，他们制作了一个很好用的网站。Google网站的技术含量是无庸置疑的，而总体计划更是直截了当。当现在他们已经有了巨大得多的野心和发展时，这种简单的计划给他们带来一年10亿美元的收益。</p>

<p>世上还有许许多多的领域，和在Google出现之前的网络搜索领域一样落后。我可以想出好几种启发创业思路的方法，不过绝大部分归结于以下的方式：观察人们的某些行为和需求，并找出满足他们需要而又不是太差的一种技术或手段。</p>

<p>举例来说，目前那些约会网站做得比Google出现之前的网络搜索服务还要糟糕得多。他们都使用同样简单的架构，倾向于用数据配对来代替真实世界的约会的重要性，水平甚至还不如一个大学生为了应付课程而做的作业。与此同时，还有很多的资金可以投注到这一领域，约会网站是一个很有价值的生意，并且有可能通过成功的运作得到百倍以上的回报。</p>

<p>一个良好的创意，只是创业的第一步。许多未来的创业者认为，整个创业的过程只是最初的那个主意，以及剩下的执行细节。而风险投资方对此有更清晰的了解，当一个创业者来到风投公司要求用他的创意换取进一步合作的时候，他甚至得不到一份保密协议。很显然，一个纯粹的创意的市场价值，甚至不如签订一份保密协议的成本。</p>

<p>原始创意不值钱的另一个例证是，很多的创业者在其实践过程中对他们原本的计划做了很大的修改。微软创始时的经营计划是贩卖编程语言等软件，而他们现在的商业模式是在创业五年后被IBM扫地出门之后诞生的。</p>

<p>创意绝对是有价值的，但问题在于，它们很难在创业过程中转变为收益。创意不是那种很容易让别人按照你的思路去执行的东西，它们的价值在于其拥有者在实践中对原始计划不断思考和修正的过程。</p>

<p>创意并不是最重要的东西，那些拥有创意的人才是。善于工作的人可以把一个烂主意变好，可是再好好主意也帮不了一个笨蛋。</p>

<p>人</p>

<p>我指的善于工作的人是什么样的呢？在我创业的过程中学到的最有用的东西，就是雇佣员工的标准。你能够明白“猛兽一般的人”这个比喻吗？这句话可能很难翻译成其它语言，不过我认为每个美国人都明白它的意思。这是说，某些人对于他们的工作有点过于认真，以至于他们在工作的过程中跨过了职业需求的限度而进入到狂热的境界。</p>

<p>对于单个人而言，这个比喻确切的意思取决于工作性质的不同：一个绝不接受客人说不的推销员；一个在凌晨四点也不愿意留下代码中的bug去睡觉的黑客；一个会冷不防打电话到纽约时报记者手机的公共关系专家；一个看到两毫米的误差就会觉得浑身不舒服的设计师。</p>

<p>在我的公司里，几乎每个人都是一头猛兽。我的销售主管，那个女人的顽强甚至让我对她电话另一头的潜在客户感到歉意。你都可以感受到他们在电话现那头挣扎，像鱼钩上的鱼一样，但是在签约之前，他们绝对不会得到任何逃跑的机会。</p>

<p>想一想你所认识的人，你会发现“猛兽”形态是很容易找到的。想象某些人的样子，然后在心里描绘下他们做那些“猛兽般”行为的状态。如果你发笑了，说明他们不是那样的人。在一个大公司中，这样的状态可能是不必要甚至不需要的，但在创业中，“猛兽”般的工作态度是绝对必须的。</p>

<p>对于黑客，我们有一些额外的标准。他确实特别聪明吗？如果是，他能够一丝不扣地完成一份工作吗？还有最后，鉴于部分很优秀的黑客会有一些不良癖好，我们是否能够忍受他们和我们一起工作也是指标之一。</p>

<p>而最后的测试只能筛选掉很少一部分人。我们可以接受一个天才的任何缺点，除了不断抱怨的那些。不过这些人通常不怎么优秀，所以我们的第三个测试基本上只是之前的补充。</p>

<p>大部分情况下，当那些讨厌的人努力装聪明的时候，他们会变得让人难以容忍。其实，越是聪明的人越是不会为此感到困扰。所以你会发现，那些充满天才的人总是较易使用“我不知道”“也许你是对的”和“我对xx事情不太了解”这类的句式。</p>

<p>这种技巧并不是一直有用的，因为人很容易受到环境的影响。在MIT的顾客满意部门，好像有一种叫做“装成一个什么都知道的猛男”的传统。听说这种态度最早起源于Marvin Minsky，而与此相类似的所谓典型飞行员姿态，则是来自于Chuck Yeager。就算是真正才华出众的人，在这个环境里也会显得有点太猛，所以你只能忍受他们。</p>

<p>这种人才选择方式让我们拥有Robert Morris了，我所见过最会说“我不知道”的一个人。（至少在他成为MIT的教授之前）。没有人会对Robert有所抱怨，因为他显然比任何人都要聪明，难得的是还没有任何脾气。</p>

<p>就像绝大部分创业活动一样，我们公司最初的合伙人仅仅是一群好朋友，而且连员工的招聘都主要通过朋友关系来进行。这是创业公司和大企业最显著的区别。和某人交几天朋友，能体会到大公司在面试中永远问不出的东西。</p>

<p>创业大半发生在大学周围，是因为那里是有才智的人的聚集地。MIT和斯坦福周围布满了高科技公司，并不是因为他们的学生在课堂上学到的东西。其实只要学校允许，他们宁可在课堂上唱野营歌。</p>

<p>如果你想要创业，和大学里的天才们一起进行会带来更好的机会，所以理论上来说你要努力和你在大学里看到的每一个聪明人交朋友，对吗？答案是不。优秀的技术人员不喜欢目的性很强的交流方式，你的努力不会有回报。</p>

<p>在大学里，你该做的是专注于你自己的项目。就算你不想创业，一个好的技术人员也应该做到这一点，因为这是唯一能够真正学会程序技术的方式。在某些项目里你将会和别的学生合作，而这是最好的结识优秀黑客的方法。有些项目可能会进化成一个值得创业的机会，不过我建议不要对此太过执着。别强制自己做任何事，只要和你欣赏的人一起做喜欢的工作就行了。</p>

<p>理想状态下，你会需要2至4个合作者。只有两个人的创业是很困难的。而单独创业者，将会发现自己面临着巨大的精神压力。即使是比尔大门，传说中无视压力的名人，仍然需要找一个合作者一起创业。不过你确实不需要像一张全家福照片一样多的合作伙伴，一方面是因为创业初期并不需要太多人，另一方面是因为越多人就越多分歧。在只有两三个人的情况下，你们会因为失败的压力迅速地处理不同意见。而7、8个人一起干的时候，任何分歧都可能长时间逗留并造成分裂的小团体。投票表决并不是好方法，全体一致才是创业的需要。</p>

<p>很多情况下，一个新公司都是基于技术型产业而建立，所以创始人需要招收技术人员。在网络泡沫时代，很多商科出身的创业者寻求优秀黑客的帮助来制造他们的产品，其结果被证明并不理想。生意人对于技术问题并不理解，因为他们不知道产品的发展有哪些可选项，会面临什么困难，有什么优势。而且他们也分不清哪个黑客更优秀，就算对于计算机领域的同业，人们也很难分清谁更优秀的问题，而一个单纯的生意人在挑选的时候就更像一场轮盘赌了。</p>

<p>那么在创业时，商科背景的人是否是必须的呢？这个问题并没有确定的答案。当我创业的时候，我们认为是需要的，所以我们向周围的专业人士询问关于“商场的奥秘”的知识以及他们愿不愿意做我们的总经理。不过他们都拒绝了，所以我只能自己来当。不过后来我发现，做生意也没有那么困难和神秘，并不像物理学或者医学那样需要大量的学习，只要努力让别人买你的东西就好了。</p>

<p>我认为，之前我把做生意看成是很神秘的东西，原因在于我本身对它有厌恶感。我希望在纯净而高度脑力化的软件世界中工作，而不是和庸俗的客户及他们的蠢问题打交道。不希望参与某项工作的人往往会用一种保护性的能力不足来作推脱。Paul Erdos是很典型的例子，人们看到他甚至不懂得如何把一颗柚子切成两半。所以别人不得不为他做所有的生活琐事，从而让他能够把自己的全部时间投注在数学商。Erdos是一个极端的例子，不过绝大多数做丈夫的或多或少使用相同的手段。</p>

<p>当我必须放弃我的保护性能力不足之后，我发现做生意并不像我之前想象的那么困难和无聊。生意经中有很深奥的部分，例如税法和衍生产品的定价，但你无需在创业的时候掌握它们。所有创业所需要的知识在任何商学院甚至大学建立起来之前就已经被人们所熟知了。</p>

<p>如果你尝试在福布斯400强的管理者名单中标记出MBA学历的名字，你就会对商学院有新的重要认识。第一个MBA在第22位出现，Phil Knight，Nike的CEO。前50名中只有4个MBA学历，而相对的，福布斯400强中的管理者有相当大一部分是技术背景的。想想Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore，高科技类产业的规则看起来是由技术员而非生意人制定的。所以如果你希望用两年的时间给你未来的创业增添一点资本，学会一点黑客技术看上去比读MBA更有用。</p>

<p>有一个重要理由会让你希望把一个商科背景的人加入到创业的队伍中：总要有个人愿意并且能够关注客户的需求。有些人认为，只有商科背景的人能做这件事。优秀黑客能够制作软件，不过不能设计它们。这种话及其荒谬。黑客没有理由因为懂得设计软件就不理解客户需求，纯正的生意人也没有理由不懂得设计软件却能神奇地理解它们。</p>

<p>无论如何，如果你不能靠自己探寻客户需求，你就必须寻找一个能够这么做的合伙人。这是技术创业中最最重要的一环，绝大部分的创业是因为这个环节而失败的。</p>

<p>客户需求</p>

<p>并不是只有创业公司需要担心客户需求。我认为绝大部分公司失败的主要原因就是他们不能给客户提供想要的东西。以餐馆为例，绝大多数餐馆最终经营失败，其中约有四分之一甚至在第一年就关门大吉。可是你记得曾经有哪一家能做出真正美味的食物的餐馆倒闭吗？</p>

<p>餐馆只要能做出真正美味的食物就足以应付一切。优秀的口味带来高昂的价格，拥挤的人群，喧嚣，热闹的氛围，坐满的座位，甚至态度恶劣的服务，而顾客们还是趋之若鹜。当然确实存在一些口味一般而靠小噱头吸引顾客的餐厅，但这样的经营方式会带来很大的风险。直接提供美味可口的食物才是最为简单有效的方法。</p>

<p>在技术创业中，情况也是一样。你可能听说过创业失败的各种理由，可是有听说过拥有一个极端受欢迎的产品的公司失败的例子么？</p>

<p>几乎每一个失败的创业案例，最终的问题都是其客户失去了对其产品的需求。基本上，所有的失败看起来都是由“资金不足”所直接导致的，可是他们弄不到资金的原因几乎都一样：产品太烂，或者根本就没有一个完成的产品。</p>

<p>当我列出所有创业者都需要做的工作的时候，曾经很想要尽快作出一个产品的第一版。幸好我没有决定这么做，因为这种急功近利的方法不利于做出顾客想要的产品。只有通过发行试用版并根据客户反馈不断调整，才是创造出适合客户需求的产品的唯一方法。</p>

<p>另一个方法是我称为“孤注一掷”(Hail Mary)的策略。你可能对一个产品做出详细的计划书，雇佣一整队的工程师来开发它，一年之后发现你投入的二百万美元变成了一堆没人要的垃圾。在网络泡沫的时代，这种情况并不少见，尤其在那些商业气息很浓的公司进入计算机技术领域的时候，他们都以为开发软件产品是一件可以完美地按照计划进行的事情。</p>

<p>我们从不认同这种做法。作为一个LISP流的黑客，我遵循着快速原型开发的传统。并不是说这种方法是用于开发任何程序（至少不在这篇文章里），不过这种方法对创业阶段需要的软件而言是绝对必要的。</p>

<p>就像大部分创业公司一样，我们进入实际操作阶段以后对我们的计划进行了修改。一开始我们的目标客户是网络咨询公司，可是他们显然不喜欢我们，因为我们的软件使用过于简单又配有自己的站点，他们的客户甚至可以直接把他们炒掉。我们认为还可以做一些网上目录供应商的生意，因为网上销售可以成为他们现有生意的良好扩展。不过在1996年，这种生意很难做。公司的中层管理人往往把网络营销视为一项多出来的工作，而不是一个机会。</p>

<p>我们得到了一些有进取精神的需要目录服务的公司的订单。其中还包括Frederick&#8217;s of Hollywood，那巨大的工作量真是对我们的服务能力的一大考验。不过大部分的客户都是些小公司，希望在网络上寻求机遇的个体商户。有一些客户拥有自己的商店，不过大部分都只在网上销售。所以我们把目标转向这些小商贩来取代原本计划中的网络咨询公司和大型零售商，也因此我们需要把软件做得更简单易用。</p>

<p>从这些经验中，我学会了一个重要原则。使你的技术易于使用是永远值得花精力去做的事。黑客们已经习惯于和电脑打交道所以不了解普通人对于不熟悉的软件怀有的恐惧心理Stephen Hawking（霍金，译注）的编辑告诉他，他每在书里放进一个公式，书的销量就会减少一半。当你致力于使你的技术易于使用时，这条曲线将随着你使软件简化的程度往上倾斜。易用性方面10%的进步，会带来的收益将是两倍的销量而不是仅仅10%的增长。</p>

<p>那要如何探寻客户的需求呢？观察。展销会是观察客户的最佳选择之一，它们往往不是用来争取新客户的，而是用来做市场调查的。在展销会上我们并不仅仅做一些简单的演示，我们还教客户建设自己的网上上铺的方法。同时我们能够观察他们使用我们软件的情况，以及和他们讨论关于产品的进一步需求。</p>

<p>大部分人把创业当成建设一家像苹果或谷歌那样的公司来看待。这些公司名气响亮，人尽皆知。但对于任何一个创业公司来说，在利基市场（类似于细分市场，长尾概念）上或者基础工业领域中还有20个以上可以成就大事业的机会。所以当你希望创业成功的时候，最好把赌注投注在这些方面。</p>

<p>从另一个角度来说，在已经有一个强大的品牌产品的市场中创业，成功的几率是相当小的。在“蓝海”（参见长尾理论）中才有最好的创业机会。因为创业的基本原则是给人们提供比他们现在使用的东西更好一点的产品，所以那些目前水平低下的产业中才蕴藏着最好的机会。相信我，你不会找到一个比大公司的IT部门的工作更烂水平的领域了，那些企业每年花费巨资在使用的软件上，可是回报却是一大堆的麻烦。这种不公平的现象意味着巨大的机遇。</p>

<p>如果你想要找一个创业的机会，你可以尝试找一个中等规模的非技术公司待几个星期，专注于观察他们和电脑应用有关的活动。大部分优秀的黑客都不能够理解普通的公司员工对于电脑的恐惧心理，就像美国的富人们无法理解巴西贫民窟发生了什么一样。</p>

<p>当创业开始的时候，尝试为小公司写一些适合他们的软件，因为这样更容易卖出去。给大公司提供比他们现有的垃圾系统更好一点的垃圾软件，是一件很花时间和金钱的工作。就算你可以用一只手黑掉Oracle的系统，你也不可能竞争过他们的销售人员。所以如果你希望用你较为优秀的技术水平争夺客户，先从小公司做起。</p>

<p>从战略上来说，小公司业务更适合创业中的企业发展。在技术领域，低端产品总能侵蚀高端市场。把一些便宜货改的好一些，其难度远小于把那些更好的软件改的便宜一些。所以低端出身的产品经过市场中的发展和创新，会逐渐地进步到可以打入高端市场的境界。Sun公司的主机就是其中的典范，而Intel在和Sun合作的过程中完成这个过程，微软的Word软件通过插页和设计框架的简单功能打入桌面文件处理软件的竞争中，大众型的数码相机生产商也会制作供给专业人士的昂贵玩具。Avid在录像处理系统中的发展，Apple紧随其后的成长，Henry Ford在已经被遥遥领先的汽车制造业中的成功，都是依靠这种模式。一种便宜而好用的产品，不仅是你创造销售额的利器，而且能够帮助你开拓更大的市场份额。</p>

<p>如果有任何竞争对手的价格和易用性比你的产品优越，那你就要当心成为别人的靶子了。</p>

<p>筹集资金</p>

<p>要使任何创业活动实现，你首先需要的就是启动资金。有些创业公司是自给自足的，比如微软，但绝大部分做不到。我认为明智的做法是寻找适当的投资人，因为依靠自有资金创业，你基本上只能做一个咨询类的公司，而这类型的业务很难转换成一个实业行的事业。</p>

<p>从资本角度考虑，创业就像一场考试。创业致富的方法并不是占有全部的股份，而是尽可能地最大化公司成功的机会。所以较好的做法是用一些股份来换取更高的成功几率。</p>

<p>对于大部分职业黑客而言，寻找投资者是一件神秘而可怕的事情。其实让我说，这只是一项简单乏味的工作。首先你需要几万美元的启动资金来开发你的软件的原型的费用。这种投资称为“种子资金”，只是小额的投资，而获取它们其实也很简单：只要开口问别人行不行就是了。</p>

<p>一般而言，你可以从那些独立投资人那里获取种子资金，这种投资称为“天使投资”，投资人往往是曾经靠技术创业成功的人士。在种子阶段，投资人并不要求你有一个详细的商业计划，他们会根据你的介绍做出快速的决定，有时资金在一周内就会到位——只要一份简单的合同。</p>

<p>我们启动Viaweb的资金是从我们的朋友Julian那里得来的一万美元天使投资，而且他还给了我们更多的帮助。身为企业律师的他曾经是一个公司的ＣＥＯ，所以我们从他那里得到了很多关于做生意的建议，还省去了我们处理自己的法律问题的麻烦。另外，他还带给我们另两位天使投资人，解决了我们下一步的资金问题。</p>

<p>有些天使投资者，尤其是那些有技术背景的人，可能会只凭一个测试版的软件或者一次口头说明就相信你的创业计划。但是大部分投资人都会想要一份详细的计划书来搞明白他们到底投资了什么。</p>

<p>回想起来，当时我们的天使投资人问我要商业计划的时候，我确实为它发了好多的愁。“商业计划”，它显然涉及到“商业”这个新奇的玩意，所以我觉得我得参考一些相关的书籍来学习怎样写好它，但是从书中却完全找不到答案。基本上，投资人会希望你给他们一个大体的描述包括你想做什么和它能怎样赚钱，还有你自己的简历。你只要坐下把你曾经告诉过别人的那些希望写下来就好了。这件事情其实不需要花一整天去做，最重要的是你还能在写下你的计划的过程中得到许多的启发。</p>

<p>得到投资以后，你要做的是建立一家公司。大致上开办一家公司并不困难，但问题在于你很难决定哪些人会成为你的合作伙伴以及你们各占多少股份。两个同等水平的人平分并不困难，但是当你有好几个在工作在不同领域和层次的合伙人的时候，合理分配股份将是无比痛苦的。不过无论如何，只要你们决定好了，这件事情就不能改变。</p>

<p>对于这件事，我没有什么好的建议。我只能说，你该尽力去做，努力做好它。不过实在要说的话，我有一个实践中的经验就是，当每个人都觉得他们得到的股份相对于他们的付出而言算是吃了一点小亏的时候，你的股权分配方式是最好的。</p>

<p>当然除了合作之外，开办一家公司还有很多事情要做。保险，营业执照，劳动补偿，和国税局打交道。我不太清楚还有什么事情在清单上，因为我们的公司完全跳过了这些玩意。。1996年当我们得到了足以创业的投资时，我们也得到了一个了不起的CFO，他把一切安排的妥妥帖帖的。不管怎么说，就算你没有把开办公司时该做的每件事都完成，也不会有人冲过来把你逮捕归案。对于创业者而言这真是天大的好事，不然鬼还敢去创业。</p>

<p>如果你得到投资又不能及时开办公司，你的部分合伙人将会有自己先出去单干的想法。这种事经常发生，而它对你们而言是很危险的。所以当你决定创业并分配好股权的时候，你应该让所有的合伙人签署一份将所有人的创意所有权归属于公司的协议，以保证每个人都只能为公司服务。</p>

<p>(如果我们在演电影，接下来的场景将会伴随着不祥的音乐）</p>

<p>当你这么做的时候，首先你要问清楚每个合伙人他们还签署过什么协议。对于创业公司而言最麻烦的问题之一就是知识产权问题。我们曾经有过，而它差点就把我们搞垮了，比任何一个竞争对手都更接近。。。</p>

<p>当我们正要被别的公司收购的关键时期，我们发现一个合伙人早些时候签署了一份将他的创意所有权交给某大公司以换取进入大学的助学金的协议。理论上来说，这份玩意说明别人在我们的软件产权中占了很大的一份。所以我们不得不对收购行动采取急刹车来应付这一问题。鉴于我们即将被收购，当时我们的现金流降低到一个很低的水平，而这个问题使我们不得不补充资金以维持公司的运行。可是当你们公司头上有知识产权问题存在的时候是很难找到投资者的，没人愿意冒着个险。</p>

<p>我们当时的投资人得知我们现金短缺之后，立刻进行了一些针对性的活动。我并不想在这里详述，除了告诉各位所谓“天使投资”，仅仅是名字好听而已。创始人被要求在留下详细的服务器操作方法给投资人之后离开公司，而当这种事情发生时，收购企业把它当成压价的砝码。</p>

<p>这些问题最后奇迹般地得到解决。投资人回来了；我们的公司得到了新的估价；而那个大公司给出一份对我们的软件不拥有产权的声明；而6个月以后我们被Yahoo以比前一家公司搞得多的价格收购。所以这还算是个皆大欢喜的结局，虽然我的寿命可能因为这次事件被缩短了几年。</p>

<p>别犯我们的错误，在你开始创业之前搞清每个合伙人的知识产权归属问题。</p>

<p>当你建立你的公司以后，可能你会觉得，去敲有钱人家的门，请求他们为你们的小主意提供上万的贷款，是一件很冒昧的事情。不过如果你站在有钱人的立场上看，这件事情是很容易实现的。他们都在寻求良好的投资机会，如果你的项目真的有钱赚，实际上他们很愿意提供资金。甚至他们可能这样想：这家伙会成为下一个Google吗？</p>

<p>通常天使投资金对创业者而言是一桩公平的买卖。他们和你分享股权及远期收益，而他们的股份取决于你对自己公司的预期。如果你用百分之X的股权换取Y的资金，这意味着你对整个公司的定价。例如，如果你用5%股权来换取10万美元，那意味着你的公司的价值是2百万美元。</p>

<p>至于你如何判断自己公司的价值，并没有一个固定的方法。某种意义上来说，创业公司就是一场赌博。当我创业的时候，我并没有认识到这点。Julian认为我们应该把公司定价几百万美元，而我认为把当时我们仅有的几千行代码换算成几百万美元是一件荒唐的事。最后我们把公司定位于100万，因为Julian说没有人回味了价值一百万以下的公司投资。</p>

<p>那时我还没有了解到，我们公司的价值并不取决于我们当时所写的代码。它还取决于我们正确的思路和创意，以及之后我们付出的诸多努力。</p>

<p>筹集资金的下一步是接触真正的风险投资公司。不过不要等到你的钱都快见底了才找他们，风投做出决策是很慢的，他们需要花几个月。而当你和他们周旋的时候，最好不要现金短缺。</p>

<p>从风投那里搞钱比从天时投资人那里搞钱麻烦得多。资金数额通常上百万，所以整场交易需要你更多的时间和精力，来面对更繁重的工作。</p>

<p>有时候风投会希望在公司里设置一个他们选定的CEO，因为他们会觉得你需要一个有商业背景，成熟稳重的领导者。也许有时候这是对的，不过比尔大门兄白手起家的时候又没有经验又没有商科背景，而看上去他混得很好。乔布斯用了一个成熟稳重有商业背景的人来管理他的公司，结果差点毁了它。所以我认为那些所谓成熟稳重有商业背景的家伙们得到了过高的估计。我们曾经把他们称为“播新闻的”，因为他们都梳着干净的头发，用一种深沉而自信的声音讲话，而且除了提词装置上显示的话之外什么都不知道。</p>

<p>我们和不少风投接触过，但最后决定完全依靠天使投资金进行我们的创业。主要是因为我们害怕一个名牌风投公司会用一个新闻播报员来收拾我们。如果他只是在那里摆摆样子，那还好。可要是他想要干涉公司运行怎么办？这将会造成一场灾难，我们的软件太复杂了，他根本不可能弄懂。我们公司的核心价值都在先进的技术上，因此基本上所有的战略决策都是依据与我们的技术发展的，对此我们不需要外行人多嘴多舌。</p>

<p>这也是当时我们的软件没有上市的原因之一。在1998年我们的CFO曾经建议我做这件事。那时候你可以通过做一个类似于狗粮专卖的门户网站来成为一家优秀的售卖有利润的真实产品的上市公司。不过我害怕这会导致我们搞来一个播新闻的，那种所谓“有华尔街腔调的人”。</p>

<p>我很高兴看到Google给了这种趋势一个嘴巴。他们上市的时候根本不理睬所谓的华尔街强调，而华尔街的投资者也不买他们的股票，现在华尔街的所有人都想要踢自己的屁股了。他们会学会重视下次机会的，有利可图的事情他们总是学的很快。</p>

<p>你会有很多的机会和风投们打交道，比你想的要多得多。因为这世界上有很多很多的风头公司，而根据我跟他们打交道的经验——你也会学到的——这完全是个卖方市场。就算现在，市场上也有无穷多的空闲资金在寻找优秀的投资机会。</p>

<p>风投公司是金字塔型的，在顶端有像Sequoia和Kleiner Perkins这样的名人，但是其下有许许多多你听都没听到过的家伙，其共同点就是他们的一块钱就是值一块钱。大部分风投的人会告诉你，他们不仅提供资金，还提供关系和建议，如果你是在和Vinod Khosla或John Doerr或Mike Moritz谈交易，这是没错的。不过这些建议和关系是很昂贵的，而你会发现他们的手下不同层级的人按照职位大小其智商直线下降。从金字塔的顶端下来一点你就会不得不和那些只懂从Wired杂志上获取新知识的银行家谈生意了。（你们的产品使用XML么？）（不明白，程序员才懂的蠢话吧，总之就是火星人的意思，译注）所以我建议你们对所谓的经验和关系的价值保持怀疑态度。基本上，风投只是资金的来源，我倾向于和任何最快提供资金的人谈生意。</p>

<p>你可能不知道该告诉风投多少关于你们的情况。鉴于他们可能有一天投资于你的竞争对手，你应该尽量诚恳。良好的计划不需要藏头露尾，不过也不需要抬头名。总而言之，就像许多风投说的，他们对于创业者的兴趣大于对项目的兴趣。他们和你谈你的计划主要是为了评价你这个人，而不是你的创意。所以只要你表现得明白你在做什么，你也可以保留一点隐私。</p>

<p>和尽量多的风投交流，即使你不想要他们的钱。因为：a）他们可能带来希望收购你的公司的人， b）如果你表现得很强势，他们就不敢投资到你们的竞争对手身上去。如果你只是想让他们认识一下你而不是问他们要钱，接触风投最有效率的方式是，在某些创业公司的展销会上向他们展示。</p>

<p>当你真的得到了启动资金以后，该如何使用呢？尽量节省着用，这是我的建议。几乎每场失败的创业都是直接因为资金断档造成的。当然其中可能有很多深层次的原因，但是这个最的直接原因是我们应该努力避免的。</p>

<p>在网络泡沫时期，几乎每个创业公司都想着“快快搞大”。理想状态下这意味着尽快争取到更多客户，但实际操作的时候却很容易演变成马上雇佣很多员工。就算你能避免如果你能争取到许多客户，那敢情好，可是这种期望往往是不切实际的。人们总是想要第一个进占市场然后囊括所有客户，一点空间都不留给竞争对手。不过我认为在绝大部分生意中先入优势都不会大到这种境界。我们再次以Google为例，当他们创始的时候搜索引擎市场看上去是一个垄断市场，大企业依靠百万美金的营销创立他们的品牌效应：Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista, Inktomi。显然1998年对于加入搜索引擎的竞争是太晚了一点。</p>

<p>不过Google的创始人们发现，品牌在搜索领域几乎没有什么价值可言。你只要在任何一点上能做出更好的产品，用户们就会蜂拥而至。作为对这一观点的佐证，Google从来不打广告。他们就像一家经销商，销售那些自己也乐于使用的产品。</p>

<p>Google超越的那些竞争者们如果将百万美元花在提升软件水平上，可能还会取得更好一些的成绩。对于未来的创业者而言这是一个很好的警示，除非你处于一个产品没有本质差异的市场上，例如香烟雪茄洗涤剂之类，不然，做一大堆广告只说明你的业务正变得越来越差。而网络业务不应该会有什么很类似的产品，那些约会网站猛打广告，正说明他们快要完蛋了。(Fee, fie, fo, fum,我闻到这些公司背后市场营销总监的体味了）</p>

<p>受环境所迫，我们公司的业务成长缓慢，但回头看来却是好事一件。每个创始人都充分掌握了公司的每项工作。除了写软件，我还必须做销售和客户服务的工作。销售业务并不好做，我虽然一直在坚持，但明显我没有一个优秀的推销员所需要的那种耐心和诚恳。我给潜在客户提供的信息是：你不在网上做销售实在太愚蠢了，如果你要在网上做销售，不用我们的软件同样是很愚蠢的。这些信息都是正确的，但显然不能让客人感到愉快。</p>

<p>不过我很擅长做客户服务的工作。想象一下，一个客服不仅对产品知无不详，而且在产品存在bug的时候还会发自内心地道歉，并立刻在和你打电话的时间内修好它。客户们简直爱死我们了，当然我们也很爱他们。因为当你只能通过口耳相传来发展的时候，你的第一批客户一定是那些主动发掘到你的优点的聪明人。在创业的早期阶段，没有什么比有头脑的客户更有价值的了。如果你倾听他们的话，他们能告诉你们很多提升你们产品的竞争力的方法。除了给你这些免费的建议，他们还正在付给你可爱的美金。</p>

<p>我们的公司在1996年正式启动，到年底的时候我们有了大约70个客户。鉴于当时是“快快搞大”的年代，我对我们公司的弱小很是担忧。不过事实上我们的发展方向才是正确的，太快的做大会让你的公司难以转向。第一年是我们提升产品质量的好时机，到了年底的时候我们的产品质量已经远远超过竞争对手的想象了。而且因为每个公司里的黑客们都已经有了充分的客户交流体验，我们对于网络营销的理解远超任何对手。</p>

<p>这些条件是我们创业成功的基石。没有比真正理解你的生意更重要的事了。你可能以为任何做生意的人理所当然的应该理解自己的业务，其实不然。Google成功的秘诀可以简单地归纳为，他们了解搜索业务。当他们创业的时候我正在为Yahoo工作，而我知道Yahoo不明白搜索这件事，因为有一次我尝试告诉公司高层我们拥有更好的搜索系统的必要性，而我从内线得到了这样的回复：我们Yahoo不要再只做一个“搜索引擎”了，搜索业务只是我们网络业务的一小部分，贡献还达不到我们一个月的增长率。我们已经是一家“传媒企业”，“门户网站”，或者其它什么高级玩意，搜索业务有没有都无所谓，就跟脐带一样剪掉也没关系。</p>

<p>确实，搜索业务只是整个页面中很小的一部分，但那是很重要的一部分，因为那是网络服务的起点。我想，Yahoo现在学到这一点了。</p>

<p>绝大部分网络服务商不明白的事，Google却了然于心。第一条就是，就算广告商付钱给你而用户是免费的，你也必须把用户放在广告商之前。我最喜欢的一张保险杠贴纸上写着，“如果群众开始自主，那领导者只能跟随。”。引用到网络业务中，这句话可以改成“争取到所有的用户，广告就会挤破你的门槛”。所以首先要为你的用户设计好你的产品，然后才去考虑如何利用它赚钱。如果你不把用户放在首位，那你的竞争对手将会有机可趁。</p>

<p>你必须了解用户心理，才能创造出他们喜欢的产品。你的公司越大，这件事就越困难。所以我说“慢慢成长”，你花钱花得越慢，你就有越多的时间去研究客户。</p>

<p>另一个节省开支的用意是形成一种勤俭的文化。这是Yahoo也很擅长的一件事。Yahoo的总裁David Filo，却对自己私底下的称号“吝啬鬼”很自豪。我们一到Yahoo就收到了他的Email，他浏览了我们的工作目录之后，询问我们是否真的需要把那么多个人资料存储在公司昂贵的RAID硬盘里。我对此印象深刻，Yahoo作为一家市值十亿级的公司，仍然能够注意硬盘中每一个字节的浪费。</p>

<p>当你从风投哪里弄到几百万美元之后，你可能会感到自己已经挺有钱了。你要搞清楚这只是一种幻觉，那些有丰厚利润的公司才是有钱的公司。资本并不代表利润，那只是投资人希望你用来获取利润的道具。所以除了银行里公司帐户那几百万，你们基本上还是一个穷公司。</p>

<p>创业初期的公司形象，应该是一个刚毕业的大学生，而不是一家律所。以酷和廉价代替昂贵和震撼的视觉效果。我们可以从一家创业公司是否使用Aeron chairs来判断他们是否明白这个道理。在网络泡沫时代，Aeron chairs在创业者中很流行。尤其是当那些公司都使用同样的型号的时候，场面就像一群用风投的钱玩过家家的小朋友。我们公司使用的椅子连扶手都没有，当年看上去有点寒碜，但回头想想，这也是我们在不知情的情况下就作对的重要事情之一。</p>

<p>我们公司处于Harvard Square的一幢木制三层楼中。1970年之前这里是一间公寓，浴室里还有有爪足浴缸的存在。这房子墙壁上用铝箔填充来阻挡宇宙射线的裂缝，代表着它曾经有过某个思路很特别的主人。当某些大人物来访问我们的办公室的时候，我们对于这幢房子的层次确实深感汗颜。不过事实上这里是一个很适合创业公司的地方，我们的角色不是那些平庸的制服组，而是虽然弱小，却勇于开创突破的幼兽。这正是创业者该有的心态。</p>

<p>一幢老式公寓同时也是软件开发的好场所。如果你尝试一下，你会发现分割成立方体的空间很合适编写软件的状态。有没有发现黑客们在家里的小空间比在办公室里工作显得轻松自在得多？那你为何不把办公室弄得像家一样呢。</p>

<p>当你选择创业公司的地点时，不要仅仅挑选那些会让你们看上去比较专业的地方。专业这个词代表优秀的工作成果，而不是电梯和玻璃墙。我建议创业者们尽量避免驻扎在专业办公楼，租一个公寓就好。创业的时候，你会经常想要索性住在办公室里，那何不就弄个可以住的办公室呢。</p>

<p>除了更便宜且便于工作，公寓往往还比办公楼位于更好的地段，在创业中这是很重要的。生产力的关键在于晚饭后的加班。这没有电话铃声骚扰的几个小时是工作出成果的最好时机。当你的员工成群结队地处去吃饭，在餐桌上讨论问题，然后回来解决它们的时候，你们的产品会发生了不起的进化。一旦你的公司进入那种所有人一下班就开个车回郊区的家里吃晚饭的境界，某些特别重要的理念基本上就不复存在了。如果你一开始创业就进入这样的阶段，那你只能求神保佑了。</p>

<p>今天如果我要再次创业，我只会考虑以下三个地点。on the Red Line near Central, Harvard, or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University or California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of campus. 这些我所知仅有的有创业成功希望的地方。</p>

<p>节省开支最重要的方法就是雇佣尽量少的员工。我可能有点极端，但我还是觉得雇佣新员工是一个公司所能做的最烂的事。在创业阶段，人工成本是巨大而令人最为讨厌的经常性开支。雇佣更多的人往往意味着过度的发展，甚至必须搬到一些不适合软件开发工作的地方。而最大的问题是，雇佣更多的人会让你的工作效率降低：以前只要把头伸进某个办公室三言两语解决的问题，现在要找齐八个人一起开个大会。所以你应该雇佣尽可能少的员工。</p>

<p>在网络泡沫时代很多创业公司采用了相反的方法，他们就想着尽快把自己做大，好像没有相关头衔的一个大部门你就没法做任何事情似的。大公司才可以这样做事情。不要雇佣人来填满你未来的组织结构图，雇佣新人的唯一理由是你有些想要做的工作没人能够完成。</p>

<p>既然雇佣不必要的员工又昂贵又没有效率，为什么几乎每个公司都这么干呢？我认为主要是因为人们喜欢有很多人为自己工作的感觉。这是一种劣根性，尤其体现在CEO身上。如果你曾经掌握一家公司，你会发现人们问的最多的问题是你有多少雇员，这是别人判断你的身价的一种方式。不仅仅是一般交往中人们会问，那些写新闻的也会注重这一点。而且他们对于上千人的公司会刮目相看，而10个人的就不屑一顾。</p>

<p>这太荒唐了，如果两家有相同收益的公司，员工数量较少的那家明显经营得更好。当别人问我我创业时有多少员工，我总是回答“20个”，而他们就会摆出那种明显不以为然的表情。我曾经想过加上这么一句“不过我们的主要竞争对手，那个有140个雇员的家伙，一直被我们打得落花流水。要不然我们用这两个数字间比较大的那个来申请贷款你看如何？”</p>

<p>考虑到办公室空间，你的员工数量最好保持在看上去紧凑和真的拥挤之间。任何一个读过大学的聪明人都会明白这个道理。当你创业的时候，别忘了保持这个员工数量。</p>

<p>你有决心么？</p>

<p>问自己以下问题。我应该创业么？我行么？值得冒这个险么？</p>

<p>绝大部分人比他们自己所一直以为的更适合创业这件事，这是我写这篇文章的主要原因。世界上其实有比现在创业的人数更多10倍的潜在创业者，如果他们都进入市场，一切会变得更美好。</p>

<p>我现在才意识到，当时我的确已经是一个很适合创业的人，虽然这个想法曾经让我感到恐惧。作为一个LISP流的黑客，我是被迫创业的，因为我原先打工的咨询公司出了麻烦，而市场上又没有多少使用LISP的公司。因为我实在不能容忍用另一种程序语言写代码（在1995年，所谓另一种语言就是C++），我不的不考虑自己创立一家使用LISP写程序的公司。</p>

<p>我知道这听上去有点不可思议，但如果你也是一个LISP流的黑客你就会明白我的意思了。我在只有创业这一条路的时候才选择开设自己的公司，仅仅因为这件事情本身在当时的我看来太过于困难了。有鉴于此，世上肯定还有很多适合创业的人却因为被这件事困难的外表吓阻而没有这么做。</p>

<p>那么谁应该自己创业呢？一个23到38岁之间，想要一口气解决财政问题而不是在打工的地方无聊地消磨时光的黑客。</p>

<p>我不能给出一个优秀的黑客的定义。在一家一流大学里这个词可能可以指计算机专业排名前50%的学员。但其实你不需要在大学里学计算机就可以做一个黑客，比如我在大学里学的是哲学。</p>

<p>在你还年轻的时候，想要搞明白自己是不是真正优秀的黑客是很困难的。幸运的是，创业的过程会自动地对你们的水平做筛选。技术人员创业的动力在于，或者应该在于以挑剔的眼光看待现存的某项技术，并且发现他们的各种缺点和解决的方法。同时这也是一个优秀黑客所应该具有的特征。</p>

<p>我把创业的下限定于23岁是因为在创业之前，你需要自己看一下别人如何经营他们的公司，而不是因为你的头脑如何如何不成熟。你的学习对象并不一定要选择创业公司。我用了一年时间为一家软件公司工作以偿还我的助学贷款，而这真是我成人后最糟糕的一年。不过虽然当时还没意识到，我确实在那里学到了软件生意中一些很重要的知识。某种意义上来说，那家公司完全是反面典型：没有会议；没有多人掌握的核心代码；没有专门负责销售和运营的人员；不做高端产品；不让人写太长的代码；不理会售后人员对于程序bug的意见；不做最大努力就放弃；不从客户那里吸取教训；不把办公室从Cambridge搬到Route128，等等等等。不过反面教材和正面教材一样有效，甚至更有效。因为灵光一现的创意是很难复制的，但是避免错误却总是可能的。</p>

<p>另一个23岁之前很难创业的理由，是人们不会把太年轻的你当一回事。风投不会相信你的能力，他们只把你当成一个骗取投资的小丑。客户们担心你的信誉，害怕你会突然撒手不管。正常情况下，就连你自己在某些方面都会怀疑自己。雇佣一个比你年长的人是很尴尬的，而21岁就当老板的你可能只想选择21岁以下的家伙，这样当然会更难发现人才。</p>

<p>有些猛人乐于在18岁就开始创业。当比尔盖茨和保罗艾伦一起创办微软的时候，他才19岁。（Paul是22岁，所以这件事情可能不是我们所以为的那样特别。）如果你觉得，无论别人说什么，你都必须立刻开始创业，那就尝试去做吧。</p>

<p>另一头，我选择38岁作为创业的底线，是有很多理由的。首先是因为我觉得自己做老板所需要的体力巨大，很难想象一个将近40的人还能支持住。那时候我能够坚持每天工作到凌晨两三点，而现在我很怀疑自己的体力能不能做到。</p>

<p>另一方面，创业是件冒险的事情。如果你尝试去做，结果在26岁的时候破产了，那还好，许多创业者大约26岁时都破产过。不过38岁的时候，你大概就很难承受这种危险了——尤其是为了你的孩子考虑，如果你有的话。</p>

<p>最后一个问题可能相当沉重。你确定你真的想要自己创业么？从经济角度来考虑，你的职业生涯可能从此走到一条独木桥上。你不再有安稳地工作40年的权力了，取而代之的可能是像地狱一样艰苦的四年。甚至你还可能破产——这件事倒是不需要四年那么久。</p>

<p>在创业的时候，你可能几乎没有时间做工作以外的事情。因为即使在你休息的时候，你的竞争者们也在前进。我唯一的娱乐活动是跑步，因为这是我保持健康的唯一手段，另加上15分钟的睡前阅读。3年中我只有两个月的时候有一个女朋友，而每两星期我去一次二手书店或者去朋友家吃一次晚饭，每星期回父母那里一次。其它时间，全都在工作上了。</p>

<p>鉴于我的合作伙伴都是我的好朋友，工作还算是有趣。在10%的时间里它甚至相当让人喜爱。对于另90%的时间，我能说的只是，事后回头看看它们，还挺有意思的。比如Cambridge断电的6小时，还有我们灾难性的在办公室里使用汽油发电机的尝试，不过我可不想再经历一次。</p>

<p>我并不认为创业的过程会比你的打工生涯发生更多的恶心事件。其实我想总数还要少一点，但是因为它们都挤在一段短短的时间内，所以看上去特别多。所以说，创业给你的最大回报就是时间。如果你在考虑开始做，首先想想你对自由的时间的感觉。如果你是那种不愿意勤恳工作40年，而是希望一次性地解决经济问题的人，那你应该选择创业。</p>

<p>很多人需要在创业和学业之间做出选择。大学生正处于合适的年纪，并且也正是软件业合适的创业人选。你可能会担心开公司会打乱你的学习计划而失去进一步深造的机会。不过在学校里就可以创业，在创业初期边读书边搞公司其实是很简单的。我们的三个创始人中有两个全天在学校里，并且都拿到了文凭。几乎没有什么比一个延期毕业的学生更有冲劲的人了。</p>

<p>如果因为创业你必须离开学校，好歹这种痛苦不会持续太长时间。如果创业是失败的，一般它都会在你失去回到学校的机会之前就结束。如果它成功了，你就不再留恋无聊的助教生涯了。</p>

<p>如果你真的想创业，尽管去做吧。开公司并不是什么难事，你不需要理解什么“做生意的奥秘”之类的玩意。创造一些人们会喜欢使用的东西，然后尽量节省开支保证有钱赚，仅此而已。不是很简单么？</p>

<p>=======================================</p>

<p>How To Start A StartUp</p>

<p>March 2005</p>

<p>(This essay is derived from a talk at the Harvard Computer Society.)</p>

<p>You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible. Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all three are doable. Hard, but doable. And since a startup that succeeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting rich is doable too. Hard, but doable.</p>

<p>If there is one message I&#8217;d like to get across about startups, that&#8217;s it. There is no magically difficult step that requires brilliance to solve.</p>

<p>The Idea</p>

<p>In particular, you don&#8217;t need a brilliant idea to start a startup around. The way a startup makes money is to offer people better technology than they have now. But what people have now is often so bad that it doesn&#8217;t take brilliance to do better.</p>

<p>Google&#8217;s plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that didn&#8217;t suck. They had three new ideas: index more of the Web, use links to rank search results, and have clean, simple web pages with unintrusive keyword-based ads. Above all, they were determined to make a site that was good to use. No doubt there are great technical tricks within Google, but the overall plan was straightforward. And while they probably have bigger ambitions now, this alone brings them a billion dollars a year. [1]</p>

<p>There are plenty of other areas that are just as backward as search was before Google. I can think of several heuristics for generating ideas for startups, but most reduce to this: look at something people are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that doesn&#8217;t suck.</p>

<p>For example, dating sites currently suck far worse than search did before Google. They all use the same simple-minded model. They seem to have approached the problem by thinking about how to do database matches instead of how dating works in the real world. An undergrad could build something better as a class project. And yet there&#8217;s a lot of money at stake. Online dating is a valuable business now, and it might be worth a hundred times as much if it worked.</p>

<p>An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning. A lot of would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is the initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute. Venture capitalists know better. If you go to VC firms with a brilliant idea that you&#8217;ll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosure agreement, most will tell you to get lost. That shows how much a mere idea is worth. The market price is less than the inconvenience of signing an NDA.</p>

<p>Another sign of how little the initial idea is worth is the number of startups that change their plan en route. Microsoft&#8217;s original plan was to make money selling programming languages, of all things. Their current business model didn&#8217;t occur to them until IBM dropped it in their lap five years later.</p>

<p>Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble is, they&#8217;re not transferrable. They&#8217;re not something you could hand to someone else to execute. Their value is mainly as starting points: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinking about.</p>

<p>What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them. Good people can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can&#8217;t save bad people.</p>

<p>People</p>

<p>What do I mean by good people? One of the best tricks I learned during our startup was a rule for deciding who to hire. Could you describe the person as an animal? It might be hard to translate that into another language, but I think everyone in the US knows what it means. It means someone who takes their work a little too seriously; someone who does what they do so well that they pass right through professional and cross over into obsessive.</p>

<p>What it means specifically depends on the job: a salesperson who just won&#8217;t take no for an answer; a hacker who will stay up till 4:00 AM rather than go to bed leaving code with a bug in it; a PR person who will cold-call New York Times reporters on their cell phones; a graphic designer who feels physical pain when something is two millimeters out of place.</p>

<p>Almost everyone who worked for us was an animal at what they did. The woman in charge of sales was so tenacious that I used to feel sorry for potential customers on the phone with her. You could sense them squirming on the hook, but you knew there would be no rest for them till they&#8217;d signed up.</p>

<p>If you think about people you know, you&#8217;ll find the animal test is easy to apply. Call the person&#8217;s image to mind and imagine the sentence &#8220;so-and-so is an animal.&#8221; If you laugh, they&#8217;re not. You don&#8217;t need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, but you need it in a startup.</p>

<p>For programmers we had three additional tests. Was the person genuinely smart? If so, could they actually get things done? And finally, since a few good hackers have unbearable personalities, could we stand to have them around?</p>

<p>That last test filters out surprisingly few people. We could bear any amount of nerdiness if someone was truly smart. What we couldn&#8217;t stand were people with a lot of attitude. But most of those weren&#8217;t truly smart, so our third test was largely a restatement of the first.</p>

<p>When nerds are unbearable it&#8217;s usually because they&#8217;re trying too hard to seem smart. But the smarter they are, the less pressure they feel to act smart. So as a rule you can recognize genuinely smart people by their ability to say things like &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right,&#8221; and &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand x well enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>This technique doesn&#8217;t always work, because people can be influenced by their environment. In the MIT CS department, there seems to be a tradition of acting like a brusque know-it-all. I&#8217;m told it derives ultimately from Marvin Minsky, in the same way the classic airline pilot manner is said to derive from Chuck Yeager. Even genuinely smart people start to act this way there, so you have to make allowances.</p>

<p>It helped us to have Robert Morris, who is one of the readiest to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; of anyone I&#8217;ve met. (At least, he was before he became a professor at MIT.) No one dared put on attitude around Robert, because he was obviously smarter than they were and yet had zero attitude himself.</p>

<p>Like most startups, ours began with a group of friends, and it was through personal contacts that we got most of the people we hired. This is a crucial difference between startups and big companies. Being friends with someone for even a couple days will tell you more than companies could ever learn in interviews. [2]</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that startups start around universities, because that&#8217;s where smart people meet. It&#8217;s not what people learn in classes at MIT and Stanford that has made technology companies spring up around them. They could sing campfire songs in the classes so long as admissions worked the same.</p>

<p>If you start a startup, there&#8217;s a good chance it will be with people you know from college or grad school. So in theory you ought to try to make friends with as many smart people as you can in school, right? Well, no. Don&#8217;t make a conscious effort to schmooze; that doesn&#8217;t work well with hackers.</p>

<p>What you should do in college is work on your own projects. Hackers should do this even if they don&#8217;t plan to start startups, because it&#8217;s the only real way to learn how to program. In some cases you may collaborate with other students, and this is the best way to get to know good hackers. The project may even grow into a startup. But once again, I wouldn&#8217;t aim too directly at either target. Don&#8217;t force things; just work on stuff you like with people you like.</p>

<p>Ideally you want between two and four founders. It would be hard to start with just one. One person would find the moral weight of starting a company hard to bear. Even Bill Gates, who seems to be able to bear a good deal of moral weight, had to have a co-founder. But you don&#8217;t want so many founders that the company starts to look like a group photo. Partly because you don&#8217;t need a lot of people at first, but mainly because the more founders you have, the worse disagreements you&#8217;ll have. When there are just two or three founders, you know you have to resolve disputes immediately or perish. If there are seven or eight, disagreements can linger and harden into factions. You don&#8217;t want mere voting; you need unanimity.</p>

<p>In a technology startup, which most startups are, the founders should include technical people. During the Internet Bubble there were a number of startups founded by business people who then went looking for hackers to create their product for them. This doesn&#8217;t work well. Business people are bad at deciding what to do with technology, because they don&#8217;t know what the options are, or which kinds of problems are hard and which are easy. And when business people try to hire hackers, they can&#8217;t tell which ones are good. Even other hackers have a hard time doing that. For business people it&#8217;s roulette.</p>

<p>Do the founders of a startup have to include business people? That depends. We thought so when we started ours, and we asked several people who were said to know about this mysterious thing called &#8220;business&#8221; if they would be the president. But they all said no, so I had to do it myself. And what I discovered was that business was no great mystery. It&#8217;s not something like physics or medicine that requires extensive study. You just try to get people to pay you for stuff.</p>

<p>I think the reason I made such a mystery of business was that I was disgusted by the idea of doing it. I wanted to work in the pure, intellectual world of software, not deal with customers&#8217; mundane problems. People who don&#8217;t want to get dragged into some kind of work often develop a protective incompetence at it. Paul Erdos was particularly good at this. By seeming unable even to cut a grapefruit in half (let alone go to the store and buy one), he forced other people to do such things for him, leaving all his time free for math. Erdos was an extreme case, but most husbands use the same trick to some degree.</p>

<p>Once I was forced to discard my protective incompetence, I found that business was neither so hard nor so boring as I feared. There are esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax law or the pricing of derivatives, but you don&#8217;t need to know about those in a startup. All you need to know about business to run a startup are commonsense things people knew before there were business schools, or even universities.</p>

<p>If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the name of each person with an MBA, you&#8217;ll learn something important about business school. After Warren Buffett, you don&#8217;t hit another MBA till number 22, Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike. There are only 5 MBAs in the top 50. What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with technical backgrounds. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore. The rulers of the technology business tend to come from technology, not business. So if you want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed in business, the evidence suggests you&#8217;d do better to learn how to hack than get an MBA. [3]</p>

<p>There is one reason you might want to include business people in a startup, though: because you have to have at least one person willing and able to focus on what customers want. Some believe only business people can do this&#8211; that hackers can implement software, but not design it. That&#8217;s nonsense. There&#8217;s nothing about knowing how to program that prevents hackers from understanding users, or about not knowing how to program that magically enables business people to understand them.</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t understand users, however, you should either learn how or find a co-founder who can. That is the single most important issue for technology startups, and the rock that sinks more of them than anything else.</p>

<p>What Customers Want</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just startups that have to worry about this. I think most businesses that fail do it because they don&#8217;t give customers what they want. Look at restaurants. A large percentage fail, about a quarter in the first year. But can you think of one restaurant that had really good food and went out of business?</p>

<p>Restaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what. A restaurant with great food can be expensive, crowded, noisy, dingy, out of the way, and even have bad service, and people will keep coming. It&#8217;s true that a restaurant with mediocre food can sometimes attract customers through gimmicks. But that approach is very risky. It&#8217;s more straightforward just to make the food good.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the same with technology. You hear all kinds of reasons why startups fail. But can you think of one that had a massively popular product and still failed?</p>

<p>In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers didn&#8217;t want the product. For most, the cause of death is listed as &#8220;ran out of funding,&#8221; but that&#8217;s only the immediate cause. Why couldn&#8217;t they get more funding? Probably because the product was a dog, or never seemed likely to be done, or both.</p>

<p>When I was trying to think of the things every startup needed to do, I almost included a fourth: get a version 1 out as soon as you can. But I decided not to, because that&#8217;s implicit in making something customers want. The only way to make something customers want is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on their reactions.</p>

<p>The other approach is what I call the &#8220;Hail Mary&#8221; strategy. You make elaborate plans for a product, hire a team of engineers to develop it (people who do this tend to use the term &#8220;engineer&#8221; for hackers), and then find after a year that you&#8217;ve spent two million dollars to develop something no one wants. This was not uncommon during the Bubble, especially in companies run by business types, who thought of software development as something terrifying that therefore had to be carefully planned.</p>

<p>We never even considered that approach. As a Lisp hacker, I come from the tradition of rapid prototyping. I would not claim (at least, not here) that this is the right way to write every program, but it&#8217;s certainly the right way to write software for a startup. In a startup, your initial plans are almost certain to be wrong in some way, and your first priority should be to figure out where. The only way to do that is to try implementing them.</p>

<p>Like most startups, we changed our plan on the fly. At first we expected our customers to be Web consultants. But it turned out they didn&#8217;t like us, because our software was easy to use and we hosted the site. It would be too easy for clients to fire them. We also thought we&#8217;d be able to sign up a lot of catalog companies, because selling online was a natural extension of their existing business. But in 1996 that was a hard sell. The middle managers we talked to at catalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but as something that meant more work for them.</p>

<p>We did get a few of the more adventurous catalog companies. Among them was Frederick&#8217;s of Hollywood, which gave us valuable experience dealing with heavy loads on our servers. But most of our users were small, individual merchants who saw the Web as an opportunity to build a business. Some had retail stores, but many only existed online. And so we changed direction to focus on these users. Instead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalog companies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.</p>

<p>I learned something valuable from that. It&#8217;s worth trying very, very hard to make technology easy to use. Hackers are so used to computers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to normal people. Stephen Hawking&#8217;s editor told him that every equation he included in his book would cut sales in half. When you work on making technology easier to use, you&#8217;re riding that curve up instead of down. A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn&#8217;t just increase your sales 10%. It&#8217;s more likely to double your sales.</p>

<p>How do you figure out what customers want? Watch them. One of the best places to do this was at trade shows. Trade shows didn&#8217;t pay as a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as market research. We didn&#8217;t just give canned presentations at trade shows. We used to show people how to build real, working stores. Which meant we got to watch as they used our software, and talk to them about what they needed.</p>

<p>No matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a stretch for you, the founders, to understand what users want. The only kind of software you can build without studying users is the sort for which you are the typical user. But this is just the kind that tends to be open source: operating systems, programming languages, editors, and so on. So if you&#8217;re developing technology for money, you&#8217;re probably not going to be developing it for people like you. Indeed, you can use this as a way to generate ideas for startups: what do people who are not like you want from technology?</p>

<p>When most people think of startups, they think of companies like Apple or Google. Everyone knows these, because they&#8217;re big consumer brands. But for every startup like that, there are twenty more that operate in niche markets or live quietly down in the infrastructure. So if you start a successful startup, odds are you&#8217;ll start one of those.</p>

<p>Another way to say that is, if you try to start the kind of startup that has to be a big consumer brand, the odds against succeeding are steeper. The best odds are in niche markets. Since startups make money by offering people something better than they had before, the best opportunities are where things suck most. And it would be hard to find a place where things suck more than in corporate IT departments. You would not believe the amount of money companies spend on software, and the crap they get in return. This imbalance equals opportunity.</p>

<p>If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a couple weeks just watching what they do with computers. Most good hackers have no more idea of the horrors perpetrated in these places than rich Americans do of what goes on in Brazilian slums.</p>

<p>Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it&#8217;s easier to sell to them. It&#8217;s worth so much to sell stuff to big companies that the people selling them the crap they currently use spend a lot of time and money to do it. And while you can outhack Oracle with one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can&#8217;t outsell an Oracle salesman. So if you want to win through better technology, aim at smaller customers. [4]</p>

<p>They&#8217;re the more strategically valuable part of the market anyway. In technology, the low end always eats the high end. It&#8217;s easier to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful product cheaper. So the products that start as cheap, simple options tend to gradually grow more powerful till, like water rising in a room, they squash the &#8220;high-end&#8221; products against the ceiling. Sun did this to mainframes, and Intel is doing it to Sun. Microsoft Word did it to desktop publishing software like Interleaf and Framemaker. Mass-market digital cameras are doing it to the expensive models made for professionals. Avid did it to the manufacturers of specialized video editing systems, and now Apple is doing it to Avid. Henry Ford did it to the car makers that preceded him. If you build the simple, inexpensive option, you&#8217;ll not only find it easier to sell at first, but you&#8217;ll also be in the best position to conquer the rest of the market.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very dangerous to let anyone fly under you. If you have the cheapest, easiest product, you&#8217;ll own the low end. And if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re in the crosshairs of whoever does.</p>

<p>Raising Money</p>

<p>To make all this happen, you&#8217;re going to need money. Some startups have been self-funding&#8211; Microsoft for example&#8211; but most aren&#8217;t. I think it&#8217;s wise to take money from investors. To be self-funding, you have to start as a consulting company, and it&#8217;s hard to switch from that to a product company.</p>

<p>Financially, a startup is like a pass/fail course. The way to get rich from a startup is to maximize the company&#8217;s chances of succeeding, not to maximize the amount of stock you retain. So if you can trade stock for something that improves your odds, it&#8217;s probably a smart move.</p>

<p>To most hackers, getting investors seems like a terrifying and mysterious process. Actually it&#8217;s merely tedious. I&#8217;ll try to give an outline of how it works.</p>

<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll need is a few tens of thousands of dollars to pay your expenses while you develop a prototype. This is called seed capital. Because so little money is involved, raising seed capital is comparatively easy&#8211; at least in the sense of getting a quick yes or no.</p>

<p>Usually you get seed money from individual rich people called &#8220;angels.&#8221; Often they&#8217;re people who themselves got rich from technology. At the seed stage, investors don&#8217;t expect you to have an elaborate business plan. Most know that they&#8217;re supposed to decide quickly. It&#8217;s not unusual to get a check within a week based on a half-page agreement.</p>

<p>We started Viaweb with $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian. But he gave us a lot more than money. He&#8217;s a former CEO and also a corporate lawyer, so he gave us a lot of valuable advice about business, and also did all the legal work of getting us set up as a company. Plus he introduced us to one of the two angel investors who supplied our next round of funding.</p>

<p>Some angels, especially those with technology backgrounds, may be satisfied with a demo and a verbal description of what you plan to do. But many will want a copy of your business plan, if only to remind themselves what they invested in.</p>

<p>Our angels asked for one, and looking back, I&#8217;m amazed how much worry it caused me. &#8220;Business plan&#8221; has that word &#8220;business&#8221; in it, so I figured it had to be something I&#8217;d have to read a book about business plans to write. Well, it doesn&#8217;t. At this stage, all most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan to do and how you&#8217;re going to make money from it, and the resumes of the founders. If you just sit down and write out what you&#8217;ve been saying to one another, that should be fine. It shouldn&#8217;t take more than a couple hours, and you&#8217;ll probably find that writing it all down gives you more ideas about what to do.</p>

<p>For the angel to have someone to make the check out to, you&#8217;re going to have to have some kind of company. Merely incorporating yourselves isn&#8217;t hard. The problem is, for the company to exist, you have to decide who the founders are, and how much stock they each have. If there are two founders with the same qualifications who are both equally committed to the business, that&#8217;s easy. But if you have a number of people who are expected to contribute in varying degrees, arranging the proportions of stock can be hard. And once you&#8217;ve done it, it tends to be set in stone.</p>

<p>I have no tricks for dealing with this problem. All I can say is, try hard to do it right. I do have a rule of thumb for recognizing when you have, though. When everyone feels they&#8217;re getting a slightly bad deal, that they&#8217;re doing more than they should for the amount of stock they have, the stock is optimally apportioned.</p>

<p>There is more to setting up a company than incorporating it, of course: insurance, business license, unemployment compensation, various things with the IRS. I&#8217;m not even sure what the list is, because we, ah, skipped all that. When we got real funding near the end of 1996, we hired a great CFO, who fixed everything retroactively. It turns out that no one comes and arrests you if you don&#8217;t do everything you&#8217;re supposed to when starting a company. And a good thing too, or a lot of startups would never get started. [5]</p>

<p>It can be dangerous to delay turning yourself into a company, because one or more of the founders might decide to split off and start another company doing the same thing. This does happen. So when you set up the company, as well as as apportioning the stock, you should get all the founders to sign something agreeing that everyone&#8217;s ideas belong to this company, and that this company is going to be everyone&#8217;s only job.</p>

<p>[If this were a movie, ominous music would begin here.]</p>

<p>While you&#8217;re at it, you should ask what else they&#8217;ve signed. One of the worst things that can happen to a startup is to run into intellectual property problems. We did, and it came closer to killing us than any competitor ever did.</p>

<p>As we were in the middle of getting bought, we discovered that one of our people had, early on, been bound by an agreement that said all his ideas belonged to the giant company that was paying for him to go to grad school. In theory, that could have meant someone else owned big chunks of our software. So the acquisition came to a screeching halt while we tried to sort this out. The problem was, since we&#8217;d been about to be acquired, we&#8217;d allowed ourselves to run low on cash. Now we needed to raise more to keep going. But it&#8217;s hard to raise money with an IP cloud over your head, because investors can&#8217;t judge how serious it is.</p>

<p>Our existing investors, knowing that we needed money and had nowhere else to get it, at this point attempted certain gambits which I will not describe in detail, except to remind readers that the word &#8220;angel&#8221; is a metaphor. The founders thereupon proposed to walk away from the company, after giving the investors a brief tutorial on how to administer the servers themselves. And while this was happening, the acquirers used the delay as an excuse to welch on the deal.</p>

<p>Miraculously it all turned out ok. The investors backed down; we did another round of funding at a reasonable valuation; the giant company finally gave us a piece of paper saying they didn&#8217;t own our software; and six months later we were bought by Yahoo for much more than the earlier acquirer had agreed to pay. So we were happy in the end, though the experience probably took several years off my life.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t do what we did. Before you consummate a startup, ask everyone about their previous IP history.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve got a company set up, it may seem presumptuous to go knocking on the doors of rich people and asking them to invest tens of thousands of dollars in something that is really just a bunch of guys with some ideas. But when you look at it from the rich people&#8217;s point of view, the picture is more encouraging. Most rich people are looking for good investments. If you really think you have a chance of succeeding, you&#8217;re doing them a favor by letting them invest. Mixed with any annoyance they might feel about being approached will be the thought: are these guys the next Google?</p>

<p>Usually angels are financially equivalent to founders. They get the same kind of stock and get diluted the same amount in future rounds. How much stock should they get? That depends on how ambitious you feel. When you offer x percent of your company for y dollars, you&#8217;re implicitly claiming a certain value for the whole company. Venture investments are usually described in terms of that number. If you give an investor new shares equal to 5% of those already outstanding in return for $100,000, then you&#8217;ve done the deal at a pre-money valuation of $2 million.</p>

<p>How do you decide what the value of the company should be? There is no rational way. At this stage the company is just a bet. I didn&#8217;t realize that when we were raising money. Julian thought we ought to value the company at several million dollars. I thought it was preposterous to claim that a couple thousand lines of code, which was all we had at the time, were worth several million dollars. Eventually we settled on one millon, because Julian said no one would invest in a company with a valuation any lower. [6]</p>

<p>What I didn&#8217;t grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn&#8217;t just the value of the code we&#8217;d written so far. It was also the value of our ideas, which turned out to be right, and of all the future work we&#8217;d do, which turned out to be a lot.</p>

<p>The next round of funding is the one in which you might deal with actual venture capital firms. But don&#8217;t wait till you&#8217;ve burned through your last round of funding to start approaching them. VCs are slow to make up their minds. They can take months. You don&#8217;t want to be running out of money while you&#8217;re trying to negotiate with them.</p>

<p>Getting money from an actual VC firm is a bigger deal than getting money from angels. The amounts of money involved are larger, millions usually. So the deals take longer, dilute you more, and impose more onerous conditions.</p>

<p>Sometimes the VCs want to install a new CEO of their own choosing. Usually the claim is that you need someone mature and experienced, with a business background. Maybe in some cases this is true. And yet Bill Gates was young and inexperienced and had no business background, and he seems to have done ok. Steve Jobs got booted out of his own company by someone mature and experienced, with a business background, who then proceeded to ruin the company. So I think people who are mature and experienced, with a business background, may be overrated. We used to call these guys &#8220;newscasters,&#8221; because they had neat hair and spoke in deep, confident voices, and generally didn&#8217;t know much more than they read on the teleprompter.</p>

<p>We talked to a number of VCs, but eventually we ended up financing our startup entirely with angel money. The main reason was that we feared a brand-name VC firm would stick us with a newscaster as part of the deal. That might have been ok if he was content to limit himself to talking to the press, but what if he wanted to have a say in running the company? That would have led to disaster, because our software was so complex. We were a company whose whole m.o. was to win through better technology. The strategic decisions were mostly decisions about technology, and we didn&#8217;t need any help with those.</p>

<p>This was also one reason we didn&#8217;t go public. Back in 1998 our CFO tried to talk me into it. In those days you could go public as a dogfood portal, so as a company with a real product and real revenues, we might have done well. But I feared it would have meant taking on a newscaster&#8211; someone who, as they say, &#8220;can talk Wall Street&#8217;s language.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m happy to see Google is bucking that trend. They didn&#8217;t talk Wall Street&#8217;s language when they did their IPO, and Wall Street didn&#8217;t buy. And now Wall Street is collectively kicking itself. They&#8217;ll pay attention next time. Wall Street learns new languages fast when money is involved.</p>

<p>You have more leverage negotiating with VCs than you realize. The reason is other VCs. I know a number of VCs now, and when you talk to them you realize that it&#8217;s a seller&#8217;s market. Even now there is too much money chasing too few good deals.</p>

<p>VCs form a pyramid. At the top are famous ones like Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins, but beneath those are a huge number you&#8217;ve never heard of. What they all have in common is that a dollar from them is worth one dollar. Most VCs will tell you that they don&#8217;t just provide money, but connections and advice. If you&#8217;re talking to Vinod Khosla or John Doerr or Mike Moritz, this is true. But such advice and connections can come very expensive. And as you go down the food chain the VCs get rapidly dumber. A few steps down from the top you&#8217;re basically talking to bankers who&#8217;ve picked up a few new vocabulary words from reading Wired. (Does your product use XML?) So I&#8217;d advise you to be skeptical about claims of experience and connections. Basically, a VC is a source of money. I&#8217;d be inclined to go with whoever offered the most money the soonest with the least strings attached.</p>

<p>You may wonder how much to tell VCs. And you should, because some of them may one day be funding your competitors. I think the best plan is not to be overtly secretive, but not to tell them everything either. After all, as most VCs say, they&#8217;re more interested in the people than the ideas. The main reason they want to talk about your idea is to judge you, not the idea. So as long as you seem like you know what you&#8217;re doing, you can probably keep a few things back from them. [7]</p>

<p>Talk to as many VCs as you can, even if you don&#8217;t want their money, because a) they may be on the board of someone who will buy you, and b) if you seem impressive, they&#8217;ll be discouraged from investing in your competitors. The most efficient way to reach VCs, especially if you only want them to know about you and don&#8217;t want their money, is at the conferences that are occasionally organized for startups to present to them.</p>

<p>Not Spending It</p>

<p>When and if you get an infusion of real money from investors, what should you do with it? Not spend it, that&#8217;s what. In nearly every startup that fails, the proximate cause is running out of money. Usually there is something deeper wrong. But even a proximate cause of death is worth trying hard to avoid.</p>

<p>During the Bubble many startups tried to &#8220;get big fast.&#8221; Ideally this meant getting a lot of customers fast. But it was easy for the meaning to slide over into hiring a lot of people fast.</p>

<p>Of the two versions, the one where you get a lot of customers fast is of course preferable. But even that may be overrated. The idea is to get there first and get all the users, leaving none for competitors. But I think in most businesses the advantages of being first to market are not so overwhelmingly great. Google is again a case in point. When they appeared it seemed as if search was a mature market, dominated by big players who&#8217;d spent millions to build their brands: Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista, Inktomi. Surely 1998 was a little late to arrive at the party.</p>

<p>But as the founders of Google knew, brand is worth next to nothing in the search business. You can come along at any point and make something better, and users will gradually seep over to you. As if to emphasize the point, Google never did any advertising. They&#8217;re like dealers; they sell the stuff, but they know better than to use it themselves.</p>

<p>The competitors Google buried would have done better to spend those millions improving their software. Future startups should learn from that mistake. Unless you&#8217;re in a market where products are as undifferentiated as cigarettes or vodka or laundry detergent, spending a lot on brand advertising is a sign of breakage. And few if any Web businesses are so undifferentiated. The dating sites are running big ad campaigns right now, which is all the more evidence they&#8217;re ripe for the picking. (Fee, fie, fo, fum, I smell a company run by marketing guys.)</p>

<p>We were compelled by circumstances to grow slowly, and in retrospect it was a good thing. The founders all learned to do every job in the company. As well as writing software, I had to do sales and customer support. At sales I was not very good. I was persistent, but I didn&#8217;t have the smoothness of a good salesman. My message to potential customers was: you&#8217;d be stupid not to sell online, and if you sell online you&#8217;d be stupid to use anyone else&#8217;s software. Both statements were true, but that&#8217;s not the way to convince people.</p>

<p>I was great at customer support though. Imagine talking to a customer support person who not only knew everything about the product, but would apologize abjectly if there was a bug, and then fix it immediately, while you were on the phone with them. Customers loved us. And we loved them, because when you&#8217;re growing slow by word of mouth, your first batch of users are the ones who were smart enough to find you by themselves. There is nothing more valuable, in the early stages of a startup, than smart users. If you listen to them, they&#8217;ll tell you exactly how to make a winning product. And not only will they give you this advice for free, they&#8217;ll pay you.</p>

<p>We officially launched in early 1996. By the end of that year we had about 70 users. Since this was the era of &#8220;get big fast,&#8221; I worried about how small and obscure we were. But in fact we were doing exactly the right thing. Once you get big (in users or employees) it gets hard to change your product. That year was effectively a laboratory for improving our software. By the end of it, we were so far ahead of our competitors that they never had a hope of catching up. And since all the hackers had spent many hours talking to users, we understood online commerce way better than anyone else.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the key to success as a startup. There is nothing more important than understanding your business. You might think that anyone in a business must, ex officio, understand it. Far from it. Google&#8217;s secret weapon was simply that they understood search. I was working for Yahoo when Google appeared, and Yahoo didn&#8217;t understand search. I know because I once tried to convince the powers that be that we had to make search better, and I got in reply what was then the party line about it: that Yahoo was no longer a mere &#8220;search engine.&#8221; Search was now only a small percentage of our page views, less than one month&#8217;s growth, and now that we were established as a &#8220;media company,&#8221; or &#8220;portal,&#8221; or whatever we were, search could safely be allowed to wither and drop off, like an umbilical cord.</p>

<p>Well, a small fraction of page views they may be, but they are an important fraction, because they are the page views that Web sessions start with. I think Yahoo gets that now.</p>

<p>Google understands a few other things most Web companies still don&#8217;t. The most important is that you should put users before advertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users aren&#8217;t. One of my favorite bumper stickers reads &#8220;if the people lead, the leaders will follow.&#8221; Paraphrased for the Web, this becomes &#8220;get all the users, and the advertisers will follow.&#8221; More generally, design your product to please users first, and then think about how to make money from it. If you don&#8217;t put users first, you leave a gap for competitors who do.</p>

<p>To make something users love, you have to understand them. And the bigger you are, the harder that is. So I say &#8220;get big slow.&#8221; The slower you burn through your funding, the more time you have to learn.</p>

<p>The other reason to spend money slowly is to encourage a culture of cheapness. That&#8217;s something Yahoo did understand. David Filo&#8217;s title was &#8220;Chief Yahoo,&#8221; but he was proud that his unofficial title was &#8220;Cheap Yahoo.&#8221; Soon after we arrived at Yahoo, we got an email from Filo, who had been crawling around our directory hierarchy, asking if it was really necessary to store so much of our data on expensive RAID drives. I was impressed by that. Yahoo&#8217;s market cap then was already in the billions, and they were still worrying about wasting a few gigs of disk space.</p>

<p>When you get a couple million dollars from a VC firm, you tend to feel rich. It&#8217;s important to realize you&#8217;re not. A rich company is one with large revenues. This money isn&#8217;t revenue. It&#8217;s money investors have given you in the hope you&#8217;ll be able to generate revenues. So despite those millions in the bank, you&#8217;re still poor.</p>

<p>For most startups the model should be grad student, not law firm. Aim for cool and cheap, not expensive and impressive. For us the test of whether a startup understood this was whether they had Aeron chairs. The Aeron came out during the Bubble and was very popular with startups. Especially the type, all too common then, that was like a bunch of kids playing house with money supplied by VCs. We had office chairs so cheap that the arms all fell off. This was slightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studenty atmosphere of our office was another of those things we did right without knowing it.</p>

<p>Our offices were in a wooden triple-decker in Harvard Square. It had been an apartment until about the 1970s, and there was still a claw-footed bathtub in the bathroom. It must once have been inhabited by someone fairly eccentric, because a lot of the chinks in the walls were stuffed with aluminum foil, as if to protect against cosmic rays. When eminent visitors came to see us, we were a bit sheepish about the low production values. But in fact that place was the perfect space for a startup. We felt like our role was to be impudent underdogs instead of corporate stuffed shirts, and that is exactly the spirit you want.</p>

<p>An apartment is also the right kind of place for developing software. Cube farms suck for that, as you&#8217;ve probably discovered if you&#8217;ve tried it. Ever notice how much easier it is to hack at home than at work? So why not make work more like home?</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re looking for space for a startup, don&#8217;t feel that it has to look professional. Professional means doing good work, not elevators and glass walls. I&#8217;d advise most startups to avoid corporate space at first and just rent an apartment. You want to live at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designed to be lived in as your office?</p>

<p>Besides being cheaper and better to work in, apartments tend to be in better locations than office buildings. And for a startup location is very important. The key to productivity is for people to come back to work after dinner. Those hours after the phone stops ringing are by far the best for getting work done. Great things happen when a group of employees go out to dinner together, talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement them. So you want to be in a place where there are a lot of restaurants around, not some dreary office park that&#8217;s a wasteland after 6:00 PM. Once a company shifts over into the model where everyone drives home to the suburbs for dinner, however late, you&#8217;ve lost something extraordinarily valuable. God help you if you actually start in that mode.</p>

<p>If I were going to start a startup today, there are only three places I&#8217;d consider doing it: on the Red Line near Central, Harvard, or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University or California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of campus. These are the only places I know that have the right kind of vibe.</p>

<p>The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people. I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing a company can do. To start with, people are a recurring expense, which is the worst kind. They also tend to cause you to grow out of your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office building that will make your software worse. But worst of all, they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone&#8217;s office and checking out an idea with them, eight people have to have a meeting about it. So the fewer people you can hire, the better.</p>

<p>During the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy. They wanted to get &#8220;staffed up&#8221; as soon as possible, as if you couldn&#8217;t get anything done unless there was someone with the corresponding job title. That&#8217;s big company thinking. Don&#8217;t hire people to fill the gaps in some a priori org chart. The only reason to hire someone is to do something you&#8217;d like to do but can&#8217;t.</p>

<p>If hiring unnecessary people is expensive and slows you down, why do nearly all companies do it? I think the main reason is that people like the idea of having a lot of people working for them. This weakness often extends right up to the CEO. If you ever end up running a company, you&#8217;ll find the most common question people ask is how many employees you have. This is their way of weighing you. It&#8217;s not just random people who ask this; even reporters do. And they&#8217;re going to be a lot more impressed if the answer is a thousand than if it&#8217;s ten.</p>

<p>This is ridiculous, really. If two companies have the same revenues, it&#8217;s the one with fewer employees that&#8217;s more impressive. When people used to ask me how many people our startup had, and I answered &#8220;twenty,&#8221; I could see them thinking that we didn&#8217;t count for much. I used to want to add &#8220;but our main competitor, whose ass we regularly kick, has a hundred and forty, so can we have credit for the larger of the two numbers?&#8221;</p>

<p>As with office space, the number of your employees is a choice between seeming impressive, and being impressive. Any of you who were nerds in high school know about this choice. Keep doing it when you start a company.</p>

<p>Should You?</p>

<p>But should you start a company? Are you the right sort of person to do it? If you are, is it worth it?</p>

<p>More people are the right sort of person to start a startup than realize it. That&#8217;s the main reason I wrote this. There could be ten times more startups than there are, and that would probably be a good thing.</p>

<p>I was, I now realize, exactly the right sort of person to start a startup. But the idea terrified me at first. I was forced into it because I was a Lisp hacker. The company I&#8217;d been consulting for seemed to be running into trouble, and there were not a lot of other companies using Lisp. Since I couldn&#8217;t bear the thought of programming in another language (this was 1995, remember, when &#8220;another language&#8221; meant C++) the only option seemed to be to start a new company using Lisp.</p>

<p>I realize this sounds far-fetched, but if you&#8217;re a Lisp hacker you&#8217;ll know what I mean. And if the idea of starting a startup frightened me so much that I only did it out of necessity, there must be a lot of people who would be good at it but who are too intimidated to try.</p>

<p>So who should start a startup? Someone who is a good hacker, between about 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one shot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working life.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say precisely what a good hacker is. At a first rate university this might include the top half of computer science majors. Though of course you don&#8217;t have to be a CS major to be a hacker; I was a philosophy major in college.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell whether you&#8217;re a good hacker, especially when you&#8217;re young. Fortunately the process of starting startups tends to select them automatically. What drives people to start startups is (or should be) looking at existing technology and thinking, don&#8217;t these guys realize they should be doing x, y, and z? And that&#8217;s also a sign that one is a good hacker.</p>

<p>I put the lower bound at 23 not because there&#8217;s something that doesn&#8217;t happen to your brain till then, but because you need to see what it&#8217;s like in an existing business before you try running your own. The business doesn&#8217;t have to be a startup. I spent a year working for a software company to pay off my college loans. It was the worst year of my adult life, but I learned, without realizing it at the time, a lot of valuable lessons about the software business. In this case they were mostly negative lessons: don&#8217;t have a lot of meetings; don&#8217;t have chunks of code that multiple people own; don&#8217;t have a sales guy running the company; don&#8217;t make a high-end product; don&#8217;t let your code get too big; don&#8217;t leave finding bugs to QA people; don&#8217;t go too long between releases; don&#8217;t isolate developers from users; don&#8217;t move from Cambridge to Route 128; and so on. [8] But negative lessons are just as valuable as positive ones. Perhaps even more valuable: it&#8217;s hard to repeat a brilliant performance, but it&#8217;s straightforward to avoid errors. [9]</p>

<p>The other reason it&#8217;s hard to start a company before 23 is that people won&#8217;t take you seriously. VCs won&#8217;t trust you, and will try to reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding. Customers will worry you&#8217;re going to flake out and leave them stranded. Even you yourself, unless you&#8217;re very unusual, will feel your age to some degree; you&#8217;ll find it awkward to be the boss of someone much older than you, and if you&#8217;re 21, hiring only people younger rather limits your options.</p>

<p>Some people could probably start a company at 18 if they wanted to. Bill Gates was 19 when he and Paul Allen started Microsoft. (Paul Allen was 22, though, and that probably made a difference.) So if you&#8217;re thinking, I don&#8217;t care what he says, I&#8217;m going to start a company now, you may be the sort of person who could get away with it.</p>

<p>The other cutoff, 38, has a lot more play in it. One reason I put it there is that I don&#8217;t think many people have the physical stamina much past that age. I used to work till 2:00 or 3:00 AM every night, seven days a week. I don&#8217;t know if I could do that now.</p>

<p>Also, startups are a big risk financially. If you try something that blows up and leaves you broke at 26, big deal; a lot of 26 year olds are broke. By 38 you can&#8217;t take so many risks&#8211; especially if you have kids.</p>

<p>My final test may be the most restrictive. Do you actually want to start a startup? What it amounts to, economically, is compressing your working life into the smallest possible space. Instead of working at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for four. And maybe end up with nothing&#8211; though in that case it probably won&#8217;t take four years.</p>

<p>During this time you&#8217;ll do little but work, because when you&#8217;re not working, your competitors will be. My only leisure activities were running, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, and about fifteen minutes of reading a night. I had a girlfriend for a total of two months during that three year period. Every couple weeks I would take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a friend&#8217;s house for dinner. I went to visit my family twice. Otherwise I just worked.</p>

<p>Working was often fun, because the people I worked with were some of my best friends. Sometimes it was even technically interesting. But only about 10% of the time. The best I can say for the other 90% is that some of it is funnier in hindsight than it seemed then. Like the time the power went off in Cambridge for about six hours, and we made the mistake of trying to start a gasoline powered generator inside our offices. I won&#8217;t try that again.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think the amount of bullshit you have to deal with in a startup is more than you&#8217;d endure in an ordinary working life. It&#8217;s probably less, in fact; it just seems like a lot because it&#8217;s compressed into a short period. So mainly what a startup buys you is time. That&#8217;s the way to think about it if you&#8217;re trying to decide whether to start one. If you&#8217;re the sort of person who would like to solve the money problem once and for all instead of working for a salary for 40 years, then a startup makes sense.</p>

<p>For a lot of people the conflict is between startups and graduate school. Grad students are just the age, and just the sort of people, to start software startups. You may worry that if you do you&#8217;ll blow your chances of an academic career. But it&#8217;s possible to be part of a startup and stay in grad school, especially at first. Two of our three original hackers were in grad school the whole time, and both got their degrees. There are few sources of energy so powerful as a procrastinating grad student.</p>

<p>If you do have to leave grad school, in the worst case it won&#8217;t be for too long. If a startup fails, it will probably fail quickly enough that you can return to academic life. And if it succeeds, you may find you no longer have such a burning desire to be an assistant professor.</p>

<p>If you want to do it, do it. Starting a startup is not the great mystery it seems from outside. It&#8217;s not something you have to know about &#8220;business&#8221; to do. Build something users love, and spend less than you make. How hard is that?</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>[1] Google&#8217;s revenues are about two billion a year, but half comes from ads on other sites.</p>

<p>[2] One advantage startups have over established companies is that there are no discrimination laws about starting businesses. For example, I would be reluctant to start a startup with a woman who had small children, or was likely to have them soon. But you&#8217;re not allowed to ask prospective employees if they plan to have kids soon. Believe it or not, under current US law, you&#8217;re not even allowed to discriminate on the basis of intelligence. Whereas when you&#8217;re starting a company, you can discriminate on any basis you want about who you start it with.</p>

<p>[3] Learning to hack is a lot cheaper than business school, because you can do it mostly on your own. For the price of a Linux box, a copy of K&amp;R, and a few hours of advice from your neighbor&#8217;s fifteen year old son, you&#8217;ll be well on your way.</p>

<p>[4] Corollary: Avoid starting a startup to sell things to the biggest company of all, the government. Yes, there are lots of opportunities to sell them technology. But let someone else start those startups.</p>

<p>[5] A friend who started a company in Germany told me they do care about the paperwork there, and that there&#8217;s more of it. Which helps explain why there are not more startups in Germany.</p>

<p>[6] At the seed stage our valuation was in principle $100,000, because Julian got 10% of the company. But this is a very misleading number, because the money was the least important of the things Julian gave us.</p>

<p>[7] The same goes for companies that seem to want to acquire you. There will be a few that are only pretending to in order to pick your brains. But you can never tell for sure which these are, so the best approach is to seem entirely open, but to fail to mention a few critical technical secrets.</p>

<p>[8] I was as bad an employee as this place was a company. I apologize to anyone who had to work with me there.</p>

<p>[9] You could probably write a book about how to succeed in business by doing everything in exactly the opposite way from the DMV.</p>

<p>哥白尼不认同托勒密的体系，一个极其重要的原因是，他觉得托勒密提出的偏心等距点(equant)毫无美感……</p>

<p>托马斯?库恩，《哥白尼革命》</p>

<p>我们所有人都受到凯利? 约翰逊①的影响，狂热地相信外观优美的飞机一定会飞得同样漂亮。</p>

<p>本?里奇，《臭鼬计划》</p>

<p>美感是第一道关卡。丑陋的数学在世界上无法生存。</p>

<p>G. H. 哈代，《一个数学家的自白》</p>

<p>最近，我与一个在 MIT 教书的朋友交谈。他的研究领域很热门，每年申请他的研究生的人多得让他应付不过来。“很多人看上去很聪明，”他说，“但是我不知道他们的品味如何。”</p>

<p>品味。如今很少听到这个词了，人们往往使用别的叫法，但它却的的确确是我们离不开的基本概念。我的朋友的意思是，他想要的学生不仅应该技术过硬，还应当能够使用技术做出优美的产品。</p>

<p>数学家会把出色的工作称赞为“优美的”。无论古今，科学家、工程师、音乐家、建筑师、设计师、作家、画家都是这样做的，他们都使用同一个词。这仅仅是巧合吗，还是他们之间有共识？如果真的有共识，那么我们能不能将某一个领域发现的“美”的规律运用于另一个领域呢？</p>

<p>对于我们设计师来说，美就不仅仅是一个理论问题了。如果世界上真有“美”存在，我们需要能够认出它。设计产品时，我们需要良好的品味。与其把“美”说成一个虚无缥缈的抽象概念，还不如让我们考虑一个实际的问题（这样就能避免喋喋不休的空谈）：如何才能做出优美的产品？</p>

<p>如果你在当今社会提到“品味”，很多人会对你说“品味是主观的”。他们真的就是这么认为的。喜欢一件东西，却不知道为什么自己喜欢它，原因可能是这件东西是美的，但也可能因为他们的母亲也拥有同样的东西，或者杂志上某个明星使用它，或者仅仅因为它的价格很昂贵。人类的思想就是没有经过整理的无数杂念的混合。</p>

<p>我们大多数人从孩提时代起就被鼓励不要去分析清楚自己的头脑。如果你的小弟弟画图时把人都涂成绿色，你想取笑他，你妈妈很可能会对你说：“你有你喜欢的方式，他有他喜欢的方式。”</p>

<p>你妈妈这时不是教给你什么是美学，而只是想阻止你们两个争吵。</p>

<p>就像大人哄小孩的其他话一样，这句话也是模棱两可的，与其他话会发生冲突。大人教导你说品味只是每个人的偏好而已。但是来到博物馆，他们却对你说，仔细观赏达?芬奇的作品，因为他是伟大的艺术家，品味超凡。</p>

<p>小孩子受到这样的教导会怎么想？他会怎么理解“伟大的艺术家”？这么多年来，别人无数遍地告诉他，品味就是一种偏好，是每个人自己的事情，所以他不可能直接就明白，所谓“伟大的艺术家”就是这个人的作品要比其他人的杰出。他更可能觉得，所谓“伟大的艺术家”只是针对我个人世界而言的，就是很符合我自己口味的艺术家，好比某本书上说食用西兰花对我的健康有利，所以我就应该喜欢吃西兰花一样。</p>

<p>把品味说成个人的偏好可以有效地杜绝争论，防止人们争执哪一种品味更好。但是问题是，这种说法是不正确的。只要你自己开始动手设计东西，就能明白这一点。</p>

<p>不管每个人的工作是什么，他们内心里都有一种愿望——把自己的工作做好。足球运动员想赢得比赛，CEO 想增加利润。做好自己的工作会真正令人感到自豪和愉快。但是，如果你是一个设计师，并且你不承认有一种人们共同认可的东西叫做“美”，那么你就没有办法做好工作。如果品味只是一种个人偏好，那么每个人都是完美无缺的：你喜欢自己看上的东西，那就足够了。</p>

<p>就像别的工作一样，只要你不断地从事设计工作，你就会做得越来越好。你的品味会出现变化，你会像别人一样有所提高。如果这样的话，那么你以前的品味就不只是与现在不同，而是不如现在的好。因此，所谓的“品味没有好坏之分”的公理也就顿时见鬼去了。</p>

<p>现在流行“相对主义”，即认为真理是相对的。即使你已经从小孩变成了成年人，这种观点依然可能妨碍你思考“品味”。但是，只要你走出狭隘的自我，至少在心里对自己说，确实存在比其他设计更好的杰出设计，那么你就能开始仔细研究了。你的品味是如何变化的？什么原因使你做出不好的设计？其他人对设计是什么观点？</p>

<p>只要你开始思考这些问题，你就会发现，众多不同学科对“美”的认识有着惊人的相似度。优秀设计的原则是许多学科的共同原则，一再反复地出现。</p>

<p>好的设计是简单的。从数学领域到绘画领域，你都可以听到这种说法。在数学中，它表示简短的证明往往是更好的证明。特别是对于数学公理来说，少即是多。在编程中，这种说法也基本适用。对于建筑师和设计者，它意味着美依赖于一些精心选择的结构性元素，而不依赖于表面装饰品的堆砌。（装饰品本身并不是坏事，只有当它被用来掩盖结构的苍白时，才变成了一件坏事。）绘画也是类似的，认真观察的、非常有代表性的静物作品往往要比表面极尽华美、但是实质上只是无意义重复的“巨作”（比如再现非常复杂的花边的绘画作品）更有价值。在写作上，这种说法意味着只说必须要说的话，并且说得简短。</p>

<p>这样强调简单似乎有点奇怪。有人会说，简单就是事物本来的样子，装饰反而意味着更多的工作。但是，当人们自己从事创造性工作的时候，好像就会忘了保持简单这个原则。刚开始写作的人喜欢用浮夸的语调，根本不像他们平时说话的样子。设计师喜欢用波浪式卷曲表现他们的艺术感。画家发现自己都是表现主义者(expressionist)。这些装饰都是花架子，在作家的长句、画家“表现主义”的画笔之下，根本就是空洞无物，表面的装饰掩盖了内部的空虚，太可怕了。</p>

<p>当你被迫把东西做得很简单时，你就被迫直接面对真正的问题。当你不能用表面的装饰交差时，你就不得不做好真正的本质部分。</p>

<p>好的设计永不过时。只要没有错误，每一个数学证明都是永不过时的。所以，数学家哈代才会说：“丑陋的数学在世界上无法生存。”他的意思与飞机设计师凯利? 约翰逊的观点是一样的：如果解决方法是丑陋的，那就肯定还有更好的解决方法，只是还没有发现而已。</p>

<p>以永不过时作为目标是一种帮助自己找到最佳答案的方法：如果你不愿别人的答案取代你的答案，你就只好自己做出最佳答案。某些大师的作品太过杰出，永不过时，使得后人几乎难以在该领域立足。自从16世纪出现了德国雕刻大师丢勒(Dürer)，后世的雕刻家都因为自己的作品被拿来与他的作品作比较而苦不堪言。</p>

<p>以永不过时作为目标也是一种避开时代风潮的影响的方法。“风潮”这个词，从字面上就可以看出，它就是一阵风似的，随着时间经常改变。如果一件东西长盛不衰，那么它的吸引力一定来自本身的魅力，而不是来自风潮的影响。</p>

<p>说来奇怪，如果你希望自己的作品对未来的人们有吸引力，方法之一就是让你的作品对上几代人有吸引力。我们很难猜想未来是什么样子，但是可以肯定，未来的人们不会在乎今天流行的风潮，这一点与上几代人是相同的。所以，如果你的作品对今天的人们以及1500年的人都有吸引力，那么它极有可能也会吸引2500年的人。</p>

<p>好的设计解决正确的问题。厨房的煤气灶有四个出火口，排成一个正方形。每个出火口都由一个调节器控制，四个出火口就有四个调节器。请问应该如何摆放调节器？最简单的摆放方法当然是把四个调节器排成一列，但这不解决问题。要是这样做，人们使用起来就很不方便，每次都要停下来想一下到底每个调节器对应的是哪个出火口。如果直接把调节器排成与出火口一样的正方形，就不会有这个问题了。</p>

<p>许多坏设计做得很辛苦，但是从一开始方向就错了。20世纪中期，有一股使用无衬线(sans-serif)字体的潮流。这一类字体接近于纯手写的样式，但是它无助于解决最主要的问题。印刷出来的文字首先应该是易于辨认的，所以能够清晰地分辨字母就是最主要的问题。传统的新罗马(Times Roman)字体是一种有衬线的字体，虽然看上去古老得就像维多利亚女王时代的风格，但是它的小写g就是可以很轻易地与小写y区分。</p>

<p>答案可以不断改进，同样，问题本身也可以不断改进。软件的难题通常可以被改成等价的较易解决的形式。历史上，物理学的主要难题曾经一度是如何诠释经典著作，后来逐渐变成对可观测到的行为进行预测，这种转变使得物理学的发展速度大大加快。</p>

<p>好的设计是有启发性的。英国女作家简? 奥斯汀的作品几乎不带有任何描述。她不告诉读者每件东西看上去是什么样子，只是把故事讲得非常生动，让读者自己把一切都想象出来。同样，绘画作品也分为描述性绘画和启发性绘画，后者往往比前者更引人入胜。每个人看到《蒙娜丽莎》都有自己的理解。</p>

<p>在建筑学和设计学中，这条原则意味着，一幢建筑或一个物品应该允许你按照自己的愿望来使用。举例来说，一幢好的建筑物应该可以充当平台，让你想怎么布置就可以怎么布置，过上自己想过的家庭生活，而不是使得你像执行程序一样只能过上建筑师为你安排的生活。</p>

<p>在软件业中，这条原则意味着，你应该为用户提供一些基本模块，使得他们可以随心所欲自由组合，就像玩乐高积木那样。在数学中，这条原则意味着，一个可以成为许多新工作基础的证明要优于一个难度很高、但无助于未来学科发展的证明。在科学领域中，总体上可以把引用次数看作对他人启发性大小的粗略指标。</p>

<p>好的设计通常有点滑稽。这条原则可能不是所有情况下都成立。但是，丢勒的雕刻、芬兰设计师沙里宁(Saarinen)的子宫椅(Womb Chair)、意大利罗马的万神殿(Pantheon)、最初的保时捷911型汽车（图9-1），在我看来都很有趣。逻辑学家哥德尔(G?del)的不完备定理就好像一个玩笑那样有意思。</p>

<p>图9-1　保时捷911E，1973年产</p>

<p>我想，这是因为幽默一定程度上反映了力量。幽默感是强壮的一种表现，始终拥有幽默感就代表你对厄运一笑了之，而丧失幽默感则表示你被厄运深深伤到。所以，强壮的标志（或者至少是特点）就是轻松面对自己的人生。充满自信的人常常像燕子一样，以一种居高临下的姿态轻盈地看待周围的一切，比如希区柯克拍摄的电影、16世纪画家布勒哲尔(Bruegel)的绘画（甚至莎士比亚也是一个这方面的例子）。</p>

<p>好的设计并非一定要滑稽，但是很难想象完全无趣的设计会是好的设计。</p>

<p>好的设计是艰苦的。如果观察那些做出伟大作品的人，你会发现他们的共同点就是工作得非常艰苦。如果你工作得不艰苦，你可能正在浪费时间。</p>

<p>困难的问题需要艰巨的付出才能解决，高难度的数学证明需要结构非常精细的解决方法（它们往往做起来很有趣），工程学也是如此。</p>

<p>当你攀登高山时，必须扔掉一切不必要的装备。在困难地点或预算不足的条件下，建筑师就只能做出很简练的设计。当解决难题成为压倒一切的任务时，那些流行样式与华丽装饰就被抛到一边去了。</p>

<p>并非所有的艰苦都是值得的。世界上有有益的痛苦，也有无益的痛苦。你需要的是咬牙向前冲刺的痛苦，而不是脚被钉子扎破的痛苦。解决难题的痛苦对设计师有好处，但是对付挑剔的客户的痛苦或者对付质量低劣的建材的痛苦就是另外一回事了。</p>

<p>在绘画上，肖像画通常占据最高地位。这不是偶然的，原因不仅是面部肖像比其他题材更能打动人，还因为我们太擅长观察脸，所以肖像画家不得不加倍努力才能达到我们的要求。如果画的是树，树枝画偏了五度也不会有人发现。但是，如果你把别人的眼睛画偏了五度，人们一眼就能看出来。</p>

<p>德国包豪斯(Bauhaus)学派的设计师采纳了美国建筑师路易斯? 沙利文(Louis Sullivan)的观点“功能决定形式”(form follows function)，但是他们实际上的理解是“功能应当决定形式”[1]。真实情况是，如果开发“功能”非常艰难，那么“形式”将不得不全部都由“功能”决定，因为没有多余的精力再来单独开发“形式”了。人们常常觉得野生动物非常优美，原因就是它们的生活非常艰苦，在外形上不可能有多余的部分了。</p>

<p>好的设计看起来轻松。优秀运动员比赛时，让人觉得他轻轻松松就获胜了，优秀设计师也是如此，他们的工作看上去很容易。大多数时候，这是一种错觉。作家的文章读起来流畅自如，但是背后其实经过了反复修改。</p>

<p>科学和工程学的一些最重大的发现在形式上往往很简单，会使得你觉得自己也想到过。可是，如果它真的那么简单，为什么发现人不是你呢？</p>

<p>达?芬奇的有些肖像画只是几根线条。看着它们，你会想只要把这十根八根线条放对位置，你也能画出如此优美的肖像画。说的没错，可是难就难在找出正确的位置。只要位置偏移一点点，整幅作品就会一溃千里。</p>

<p>白描其实是最难画的视觉媒介，因为它们要求几近完美的再现。用数学语言说，线条属于闭合解(closed-form solution)，水平不够的艺术家没有办法直接解决问题，只能通过不断逼近来求解。许多孩子在十岁左右放弃了绘画，原因之一就是这时他们开始学习成年人的绘画技法，首先练习用线条勾勒出人脸。</p>

<p>在大多数领域，看上去容易的事情，背后都需要大量的练习。练习的作用也许是训练你把刻意为之的事情变成一种自觉的行为。有时，我们的训练只是为了让身体养成下意识的反应。优秀钢琴家弹奏名曲可以不经过大脑直接完成，艺术家也是这样，熟练以后，脑海中的艺术形象会自动从手上流淌出来，仿佛有人在一旁为他打节奏一样。</p>

<p>人们有时会说自己有了“状态”，我的理解是，他们这时可以控制自己的脊髓。脊髓是更本能的反应，面对难题时，它能释放你的直觉。</p>

<p>好的设计会运用对称。对称也许只是简洁性的一种表现，但是它十分重要，值得单独列为一点。自然界的对称大量存在，这就说明了对称的重要性。</p>

<p>对称有两种：重复性对称和递归性对称。递归性对称就是指子元素的重复，比如树叶上叶脉的纹路。</p>

<p>历史上，对称曾经泛滥一时，导致现在它在某些领域已经不流行了。从维多利亚女王时代开始，建筑师就有意多建造不对称的建筑。20世纪20年代，不对称成了现代主义建筑的一个明确的前提条件。但是即使如此，这些建筑物往往也只是在主轴上不对称，细节部分依然大量使用对称。</p>

<p>在写作中，你会发现对称无处不在，短语、句子、小说的情节都是如此。音乐和美术也大量使用对称。拼接式的美术作品（还有塞尚的一部分作品）有非常强烈的视觉感染力，原因就是整幅作品由相同的作图元素构成，这也属于对称。对称性构图产生了一些最让人难忘的绘画作品，尤其是那些两个半边互相呼应的作品，比如米开朗基罗的壁画《创世纪》和格兰特?伍德的油画《美国式哥特》。</p>

<p>在数学和工程学中，递归尤其有用。归纳式证明方法既简洁又美妙。在软件中，能用递归解决的问题通常代表已经找到了最佳解法。巴黎的埃菲尔铁塔如此引人注目，部分原因就是它的外形是递归的，大塔上面还有小塔（图9-2）。</p>

<p>图9-2　埃菲尔铁塔，1889。大塔上面有小塔2</p>

<p>对称的危险在于它可以用来取代思考，在大量使用重复的时候这种危险性更大。</p>

<p>好的设计师法自然。我不是说模仿大自然这种行为本身有多么好，而是说大自然在长期的演化中已经解决了很多设计问题。所以，如果你的设计与大自然很接近，那么它基本上不会很差。</p>

<p>模仿不算作弊。如果一部小说写得好像真实生活的再现，没人会提出异议。虽然写实的价值常常被误解，但它也是绘画的一个重要工具。写实的目的不是为了给生活留下一模一样的记录，而是为你的思想提供一个咀嚼点：你的眼睛看着某样东西，你的手就代表你的思想，画出一些比较有意思的内容。</p>

<p>模仿大自然也是工程学的有效方法。长久以来，船只就像动物一样有龙骨和肋骨。不过，前提条件是技术水平要达到，只有这样才有可能模仿大自然。早期的飞机设计师按照鸟的形状设计飞机，这样做其实是错的，因为那时还没有足以模拟鸟类行为的轻型材料和能源，也做不出高度复杂的控制系统，所以飞机还不可能像鸟类那样飞②。但是，我能想象五十年后，小型的无人侦察飞机可以做得完全像鸟一样。</p>

<p>现在的计算机已经很强大了，不仅能模拟出大自然的环境，还能模拟大自然发展演变的结果。遗传算法可能会创造出正常条件下难以设计的复杂事物。</p>

<p>图9-3　达?芬奇，《一匹直立的马的研究》，1481—1499</p>

<p>好的设计就是再设计。很少有人一次就把事情做对。专家的做法是先完成一个早期原型，然后提出修改计划，最后把早期原型扔掉。</p>

<p>扔掉早期原型是需要信心的，你必须有本事看出什么地方还可以改进。举例来说，刚刚开始学画的人往往不愿意重画画错的地方。他们觉得能画成现在这样已经很不错了，如果重画某些部分，结果可能还不如现在。所以，他们就说服自己，我的画已经过得去了，没准别人也会这么看。</p>

<p>这想法很危险。你应该培养对自己的不满。达?芬奇为了把一根线画对，经常要画五六次。保时捷911型汽车的原型很粗糙，只有在重新设计后它的背部轮廓才变成现在这样独特的曲线。建筑师莱特设计的古根海姆博物馆，最早的时候，右半边有点像古代的塔庙(ziggurat)，他后来把它倒过来，就成了现在的样子。</p>

<p>犯错误是很正常的事情。你不要把犯错看成灾难，要勇于承认、勇于改正。达?芬奇实际上重新发明了素描这种艺术形式，把它当作一种探索更多可能的方式。开源软件因为公开承认自己会有bug，反而使得代码的bug比较少。</p>

<p>做修改的时候，有一个合适的工具会使得改动更容易。美术史上，15世纪油彩取代蛋彩(tempera)③就是一个重大突破，油彩使得画家更方便地处理那些困难的主题（比如人体），因为油彩可以调制，还可以重画，蛋彩就做不到这些。</p>

<p>好的设计允许复制。我们对待复制的态度经常是一个否定之否定的过程。刚入门的新手不知不觉地模仿他人，逐渐熟练之后才开始创作原创性作品。最后他会意识到，把事情做对比原创更重要。</p>

<p>不知不觉的模仿几乎必然将导致坏设计。如果你不知道自己的想法从何而来，那么你可能就是在模仿另一个模仿者。19世纪中期，拉斐尔画派主导了整个画坛，几乎每个学画的人都在模仿拉斐尔，可是经常谬以千里。有一些艺术家实在看不下去了，被如此之多模仿拉斐尔的人搞烦了，于是成立了前拉斐尔画派④。</p>

<p>等到你逐渐对一件事产生热情的时候，就不会满足于模仿了。你的品味就进入了第二阶段，开始自觉地进行原创。</p>

<p>我想，最伟大的大师最终会达到一种超脱自我的境界。他们一心想找到正确答案，如果别人已经回答出了一部分，那就没理由不拿来用。他们足够自信地使用他人的成果，完全不担心因此丧失个人的特点。</p>

<p>好的设计常常是奇特的。某些最出色的作品堪称不可思议：欧拉公式、16世纪画家布勒哲尔的《雪中猎人》（图9-4）、SR-71“黑鸟”超音速侦察机（图9-5）、计算机的 Lisp 语言等。它们不仅优美，而且美得很奇特。
图9-4　布勒哲尔的《雪中猎人》，1565年
图9-5　洛克希德公司的SR-71“黑鸟”超音速侦察机，1964年</p>

<p>我不太确定原因，可能是因为我不够聪明，才会觉得它们看上去很奇特。一条狗看到开罐器也会认为那是一个奇迹。如果我是天才的话，可能会觉得是再平常不过的事情，它又没有说错，有什么好奇怪的。</p>

<p>我在前文提到的好设计的大多数特点都是可以培育出来的，但是我觉得“奇特”这个特点是无法培育的。你最多就是在它开始显现时不要把它扼杀掉。爱因斯坦并不想让相对论变得很奇特，他只想找出真理，是真理本身显得很奇特。</p>

<p>我曾在一家美术学校学习绘画，那里的学生最想做的就是发展出一种自己的风格。但是，如果你想做出好作品，不可避免地会采用一种独特的方式，就好像每个人走路的姿势其实都不尽相同。米开朗基罗并没想过要树立米开朗基罗风格，他只是想画好作品，结果不由自主地创造出了米开朗基罗风格。</p>

<p>你最后发展出来的风格是自然而然形成的。“奇特”这个特点尤其如此，没有其他路可走。它就像连接大西洋和太平洋的“西北航道”，无数人希望找到这条捷径。16世纪的风格主义者、19世纪的浪漫主义者、一代代的美国高中生都在寻找，但就是找不到。唯一达到“奇特”的方法，就是追求做出好作品，完成之后再回过头看。</p>

<p>好的设计会成批出现。15世纪住在佛罗伦萨的伟大艺术家有建筑师布鲁内莱斯基、画家吉贝尔蒂、雕塑家多纳泰洛、画家马萨乔、画家菲利普里皮、画家弗拉安吉利科、雕塑家韦罗基奥、画家波提切利、达?芬奇和米开朗基罗。当时，米兰也是同等的大城市，请问你能说出15世纪米兰城有什么伟大艺术家吗？</p>

<p>15世纪的佛罗伦萨有一些独特的条件，它们是不可延续的，因为今天的佛罗伦萨已经不是如此了。我们还必须假设达?芬奇和米开朗基罗拥有的天赋，在米兰城里一定也有人拥有。那么为什么没有出现米兰的达?芬奇呢？</p>

<p>今天，生活在美国的人口大概是15世纪佛罗伦萨的一千倍。那么按照比例推算，在我们之中存在着一千个达?芬奇和一千个米开朗基罗。如果这种推算成立，我们应该每天都看到令人惊叹的艺术奇迹。但是，事实并非如此，原因就是达?芬奇的出现除了他本身的天赋以外，还有赖于1450年的佛罗伦萨。</p>

<p>推动人才成批涌现的最大因素就是，让有天赋的人聚在一起，共同解决某个难题。互相激励比天赋更重要，达?芬奇之所以成为达?芬奇，主要原因不仅仅是他的天赋，更重要的是他生活在当时的佛罗伦萨，而不是米兰。今天，人类生活的流动性高得多，但是伟大的项目依然不成比例地集中在少数几个热点上：德国包豪斯建筑学院、曼哈顿计划、《纽约客》杂志、洛克希德公司的臭鼬工作室、施乐公司的帕洛阿尔托研究中心。</p>

<p>在历史的任何时刻都有一些热点项目，一些团体在这些项目上做出伟大的成绩。如果你远离这些中心，几乎不可能单靠自己就取得伟大成果。某种程度上，你个人最多可以对趋势产生一定的影响，但是你不可能决定趋势，实际上是趋势决定了你。（或许有人办得到，但是米兰的达?芬奇显然没有办到。）</p>

<p>好的设计常常是大胆的。在任何一段历史中，人们都会把某些荒谬的东西当作正确的，并且深信不疑，以至于一旦你出言质疑，就有被排挤或者被暴力伤害的危险。</p>

<p>我们自己的这个时代要是不同以往，当然令人欢欣鼓舞。但是就我所知，它并没有任何不同。</p>

<p>这个问题不仅存在于每个年代，还或多或少存在于每个领域。许多文艺复兴时期的艺术作品在当时都被认为极其大逆不道。根据意大利画家瓦萨里的记载, 波提切利因此向教会忏悔并且放弃绘画，巴尔托洛梅奥和洛伦索迪克雷迪则是把自己的作品烧掉。爱因斯坦的相对论触犯了许多同时代的物理学家，许多年后还没有被完全接受，法国物理学家直到20世纪50年代才接受相对论[2]。</p>

<p>今天的实验性错误就是明天的新理论。如果你想做出伟大的新成果，那就不能对常识与真理不相吻合之处视而不见，反而应该特别注意才对。</p>

<p>实际上，我觉得发现丑陋的东西要比你想象出一个优美的东西更容易。大多数做出优美成果的人好像只是为了修正他们眼中丑陋的东西。伟大成果的出现常常来源于某人看到一样东西后，心想我能做得比这更好。拜占庭帝国的《圣母像》最早是根据某个公认的模板画的，非常机械呆板。几百年后的14世纪，意大利画家乔托看到以后，深感不满，决定动手改进，他因此成为文艺复兴的先行者。哥白尼对地心说无法解释的事情深感困扰，他的同时代人都觉得这可以忍受，他却认为一定能找到一种更好的解释。</p>

<p>单单是无法容忍丑陋的东西还不够，只有对这个领域非常熟悉，你才可能发现哪些地方可以动手改进。你必须锻炼自己。只有在成为某个领域的专家之后，你才会听到心里有一个细微的声音说：“这样解决太糟糕了！一定有更好的选择。”不要忽视这种声音，要培育它们。优秀作品的秘诀就是：非常严格的品味，再加上实现这种品味的能力。

Taste For Makers</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Copernicus&#8217; aesthetic objections to [equants] provided one essential motive for his rejection of the Ptolemaic system&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>Thomas Kuhn, The Copernican Revolution</li>
</ul>


<p>&#8220;All of us had been trained by Kelly Johnson and believed fanatically in his insistence that an airplane that looked beautiful would fly the same way.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>Ben Rich, Skunk Works</li>
</ul>


<p>&#8220;Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>G. H. Hardy, A Mathematician&#8217;s Apology</li>
</ul>


<p>I was talking recently to a friend who teaches at MIT. His field is hot now and every year he is inundated by applications from would-be graduate students. &#8220;A lot of them seem smart,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What I can&#8217;t tell is whether they have any kind of taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taste. You don&#8217;t hear that word much now. And yet we still need the underlying concept, whatever we call it. What my friend meant was that he wanted students who were not just good technicians, but who could use their technical knowledge to design beautiful things.</p>

<p>Mathematicians call good work &#8220;beautiful,&#8221; and so, either now or in the past, have scientists, engineers, musicians, architects, designers, writers, and painters. Is it just a coincidence that they used the same word, or is there some overlap in what they meant? If there is an overlap, can we use one field&#8217;s discoveries about beauty to help us in another?</p>

<p>For those of us who design things, these are not just theoretical questions. If there is such a thing as beauty, we need to be able to recognize it. We need good taste to make good things. Instead of treating beauty as an airy abstraction, to be either blathered about or avoided depending on how one feels about airy abstractions, let&#8217;s try considering it as a practical question: how do you make good stuff?</p>

<p>If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tell you that &#8220;taste is subjective.&#8221; They believe this because it really feels that way to them. When they like something, they have no idea why. It could be because it&#8217;s beautiful, or because their mother had one, or because they saw a movie star with one in a magazine, or because they know it&#8217;s expensive. Their thoughts are a tangle of unexamined impulses.</p>

<p>Most of us are encouraged, as children, to leave this tangle unexamined. If you make fun of your little brother for coloring people green in his coloring book, your mother is likely to tell you something like &#8220;you like to do it your way and he likes to do it his way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Your mother at this point is not trying to teach you important truths about aesthetics. She&#8217;s trying to get the two of you to stop bickering.</p>

<p>Like many of the half-truths adults tell us, this one contradicts other things they tell us. After dinning into you that taste is merely a matter of personal preference, they take you to the museum and tell you that you should pay attention because Leonardo is a great artist.</p>

<p>What goes through the kid&#8217;s head at this point? What does he think &#8220;great artist&#8221; means? After having been told for years that everyone just likes to do things their own way, he is unlikely to head straight for the conclusion that a great artist is someone whose work is better than the others&#8217;. A far more likely theory, in his Ptolemaic model of the universe, is that a great artist is something that&#8217;s good for you, like broccoli, because someone said so in a book.</p>

<p>Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good way to prevent disputes. The trouble is, it&#8217;s not true. You feel this when you start to design things.</p>

<p>Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do better. Football players like to win games. CEOs like to increase earnings. It&#8217;s a matter of pride, and a real pleasure, to get better at your job. But if your job is to design things, and there is no such thing as beauty, then there is no way to get better at your job. If taste is just personal preference, then everyone&#8217;s is already perfect: you like whatever you like, and that&#8217;s it.</p>

<p>As in any job, as you continue to design things, you&#8217;ll get better at it. Your tastes will change. And, like anyone who gets better at their job, you&#8217;ll know you&#8217;re getting better. If so, your old tastes were not merely different, but worse. Poof goes the axiom that taste can&#8217;t be wrong.</p>

<p>Relativism is fashionable at the moment, and that may hamper you from thinking about taste, even as yours grows. But if you come out of the closet and admit, at least to yourself, that there is such a thing as good and bad design, then you can start to study good design in detail. How has your taste changed? When you made mistakes, what caused you to make them? What have other people learned about design?</p>

<p>Once you start to examine the question, it&#8217;s surprising how much different fields&#8217; ideas of beauty have in common. The same principles of good design crop up again and again.</p>

<p>Good design is simple. You hear this from math to painting. In math it means that a shorter proof tends to be a better one. Where axioms are concerned, especially, less is more. It means much the same thing in programming. For architects and designers it means that beauty should depend on a few carefully chosen structural elements rather than a profusion of superficial ornament. (Ornament is not in itself bad, only when it&#8217;s camouflage on insipid form.) Similarly, in painting, a still life of a few carefully observed and solidly modelled objects will tend to be more interesting than a stretch of flashy but mindlessly repetitive painting of, say, a lace collar. In writing it means: say what you mean and say it briefly.</p>

<p>It seems strange to have to emphasize simplicity. You&#8217;d think simple would be the default. Ornate is more work. But something seems to come over people when they try to be creative. Beginning writers adopt a pompous tone that doesn&#8217;t sound anything like the way they speak. Designers trying to be artistic resort to swooshes and curlicues. Painters discover that they&#8217;re expressionists. It&#8217;s all evasion. Underneath the long words or the &#8220;expressive&#8221; brush strokes, there is not much going on, and that&#8217;s frightening.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re forced to be simple, you&#8217;re forced to face the real problem. When you can&#8217;t deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.</p>

<p>Good design is timeless. In math, every proof is timeless unless it contains a mistake. So what does Hardy mean when he says there is no permanent place for ugly mathematics? He means the same thing Kelly Johnson did: if something is ugly, it can&#8217;t be the best solution. There must be a better one, and eventually someone will discover it.</p>

<p>Aiming at timelessness is a way to make yourself find the best answer: if you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself. Some of the greatest masters did this so well that they left little room for those who came after. Every engraver since Durer has had to live in his shadow.</p>

<p>Aiming at timelessness is also a way to evade the grip of fashion. Fashions almost by definition change with time, so if you can make something that will still look good far into the future, then its appeal must derive more from merit and less from fashion.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, if you want to make something that will appeal to future generations, one way to do it is to try to appeal to past generations. It&#8217;s hard to guess what the future will be like, but we can be sure it will be like the past in caring nothing for present fashions. So if you can make something that appeals to people today and would also have appealed to people in 1500, there is a good chance it will appeal to people in 2500.</p>

<p>Good design solves the right problem. The typical stove has four burners arranged in a square, and a dial to control each. How do you arrange the dials? The simplest answer is to put them in a row. But this is a simple answer to the wrong question. The dials are for humans to use, and if you put them in a row, the unlucky human will have to stop and think each time about which dial matches which burner. Better to arrange the dials in a square like the burners.</p>

<p>A lot of bad design is industrious, but misguided. In the mid twentieth century there was a vogue for setting text in sans-serif fonts. These fonts are closer to the pure, underlying letterforms. But in text that&#8217;s not the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve. For legibility it&#8217;s more important that letters be easy to tell apart. It may look Victorian, but a Times Roman lowercase g is easy to tell from a lowercase y.</p>

<p>Problems can be improved as well as solutions. In software, an intractable problem can usually be replaced by an equivalent one that&#8217;s easy to solve. Physics progressed faster as the problem became predicting observable behavior, instead of reconciling it with scripture.</p>

<p>Good design is suggestive. Jane Austen&#8217;s novels contain almost no description; instead of telling you how everything looks, she tells her story so well that you envision the scene for yourself. Likewise, a painting that suggests is usually more engaging than one that tells. Everyone makes up their own story about the Mona Lisa.</p>

<p>In architecture and design, this principle means that a building or object should let you use it how you want: a good building, for example, will serve as a backdrop for whatever life people want to lead in it, instead of making them live as if they were executing a program written by the architect.</p>

<p>In software, it means you should give users a few basic elements that they can combine as they wish, like Lego. In math it means a proof that becomes the basis for a lot of new work is preferable to a proof that was difficult, but doesn&#8217;t lead to future discoveries; in the sciences generally, citation is considered a rough indicator of merit.</p>

<p>Good design is often slightly funny. This one may not always be true. But Durer&#8217;s engravings and Saarinen&#8217;s womb chair and the Pantheon and the original Porsche 911 all seem to me slightly funny. Godel&#8217;s incompleteness theorem seems like a practical joke.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s because humor is related to strength. To have a sense of humor is to be strong: to keep one&#8217;s sense of humor is to shrug off misfortunes, and to lose one&#8217;s sense of humor is to be wounded by them. And so the mark&#8211; or at least the prerogative&#8211; of strength is not to take oneself too seriously. The confident will often, like swallows, seem to be making fun of the whole process slightly, as Hitchcock does in his films or Bruegel in his paintings&#8211; or Shakespeare, for that matter.</p>

<p>Good design may not have to be funny, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine something that could be called humorless also being good design.</p>

<p>Good design is hard. If you look at the people who&#8217;ve done great work, one thing they all seem to have in common is that they worked very hard. If you&#8217;re not working hard, you&#8217;re probably wasting your time.</p>

<p>Hard problems call for great efforts. In math, difficult proofs require ingenious solutions, and those tend to be interesting. Ditto in engineering.</p>

<p>When you have to climb a mountain you toss everything unnecessary out of your pack. And so an architect who has to build on a difficult site, or a small budget, will find that he is forced to produce an elegant design. Fashions and flourishes get knocked aside by the difficult business of solving the problem at all.</p>

<p>Not every kind of hard is good. There is good pain and bad pain. You want the kind of pain you get from going running, not the kind you get from stepping on a nail. A difficult problem could be good for a designer, but a fickle client or unreliable materials would not be.</p>

<p>In art, the highest place has traditionally been given to paintings of people. There is something to this tradition, and not just because pictures of faces get to press buttons in our brains that other pictures don&#8217;t. We are so good at looking at faces that we force anyone who draws them to work hard to satisfy us. If you draw a tree and you change the angle of a branch five degrees, no one will know. When you change the angle of someone&#8217;s eye five degrees, people notice.</p>

<p>When Bauhaus designers adopted Sullivan&#8217;s &#8220;form follows function,&#8221; what they meant was, form should follow function. And if function is hard enough, form is forced to follow it, because there is no effort to spare for error. Wild animals are beautiful because they have hard lives.</p>

<p>Good design looks easy. Like great athletes, great designers make it look easy. Mostly this is an illusion. The easy, conversational tone of good writing comes only on the eighth rewrite.</p>

<p>In science and engineering, some of the greatest discoveries seem so simple that you say to yourself, I could have thought of that. The discoverer is entitled to reply, why didn&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>Some Leonardo heads are just a few lines. You look at them and you think, all you have to do is get eight or ten lines in the right place and you&#8217;ve made this beautiful portrait. Well, yes, but you have to get them in exactly the right place. The slightest error will make the whole thing collapse.</p>

<p>Line drawings are in fact the most difficult visual medium, because they demand near perfection. In math terms, they are a closed-form solution; lesser artists literally solve the same problems by successive approximation. One of the reasons kids give up drawing at ten or so is that they decide to start drawing like grownups, and one of the first things they try is a line drawing of a face. Smack!</p>

<p>In most fields the appearance of ease seems to come with practice. Perhaps what practice does is train your unconscious mind to handle tasks that used to require conscious thought. In some cases you literally train your body. An expert pianist can play notes faster than the brain can send signals to his hand. Likewise an artist, after a while, can make visual perception flow in through his eye and out through his hand as automatically as someone tapping his foot to a beat.</p>

<p>When people talk about being in &#8220;the zone,&#8221; I think what they mean is that the spinal cord has the situation under control. Your spinal cord is less hesitant, and it frees conscious thought for the hard problems.</p>

<p>Good design uses symmetry. I think symmetry may just be one way to achieve simplicity, but it&#8217;s important enough to be mentioned on its own. Nature uses it a lot, which is a good sign.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of symmetry, repetition and recursion. Recursion means repetition in subelements, like the pattern of veins in a leaf.</p>

<p>Symmetry is unfashionable in some fields now, in reaction to excesses in the past. Architects started consciously making buildings asymmetric in Victorian times and by the 1920s asymmetry was an explicit premise of modernist architecture. Even these buildings only tended to be asymmetric about major axes, though; there were hundreds of minor symmetries.</p>

<p>In writing you find symmetry at every level, from the phrases in a sentence to the plot of a novel. You find the same in music and art. Mosaics (and some Cezannes) get extra visual punch by making the whole picture out of the same atoms. Compositional symmetry yields some of the most memorable paintings, especially when two halves react to one another, as in the Creation of Adam or American Gothic.</p>

<p>In math and engineering, recursion, especially, is a big win. Inductive proofs are wonderfully short. In software, a problem that can be solved by recursion is nearly always best solved that way. The Eiffel Tower looks striking partly because it is a recursive solution, a tower on a tower.</p>

<p>The danger of symmetry, and repetition especially, is that it can be used as a substitute for thought.</p>

<p>Good design resembles nature. It&#8217;s not so much that resembling nature is intrinsically good as that nature has had a long time to work on the problem. It&#8217;s a good sign when your answer resembles nature&#8217;s.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not cheating to copy. Few would deny that a story should be like life. Working from life is a valuable tool in painting too, though its role has often been misunderstood. The aim is not simply to make a record. The point of painting from life is that it gives your mind something to chew on: when your eyes are looking at something, your hand will do more interesting work.</p>

<p>Imitating nature also works in engineering. Boats have long had spines and ribs like an animal&#8217;s ribcage. In some cases we may have to wait for better technology: early aircraft designers were mistaken to design aircraft that looked like birds, because they didn&#8217;t have materials or power sources light enough (the Wrights&#8217; engine weighed 152 lbs. and generated only 12 hp.) or control systems sophisticated enough for machines that flew like birds, but I could imagine little unmanned reconnaissance planes flying like birds in fifty years.</p>

<p>Now that we have enough computer power, we can imitate nature&#8217;s method as well as its results. Genetic algorithms may let us create things too complex to design in the ordinary sense.</p>

<p>Good design is redesign. It&#8217;s rare to get things right the first time. Experts expect to throw away some early work. They plan for plans to change.</p>

<p>It takes confidence to throw work away. You have to be able to think, there&#8217;s more where that came from. When people first start drawing, for example, they&#8217;re often reluctant to redo parts that aren&#8217;t right; they feel they&#8217;ve been lucky to get that far, and if they try to redo something, it will turn out worse. Instead they convince themselves that the drawing is not that bad, really&#8211; in fact, maybe they meant it to look that way.</p>

<p>Dangerous territory, that; if anything you should cultivate dissatisfaction. In Leonardo&#8217;s drawings there are often five or six attempts to get a line right. The distinctive back of the Porsche 911 only appeared in the redesign of an awkward prototype. In Wright&#8217;s early plans for the Guggenheim, the right half was a ziggurat; he inverted it to get the present shape.</p>

<p>Mistakes are natural. Instead of treating them as disasters, make them easy to acknowledge and easy to fix. Leonardo more or less invented the sketch, as a way to make drawing bear a greater weight of exploration. Open-source software has fewer bugs because it admits the possibility of bugs.</p>

<p>It helps to have a medium that makes change easy. When oil paint replaced tempera in the fifteenth century, it helped painters to deal with difficult subjects like the human figure because, unlike tempera, oil can be blended and overpainted.</p>

<p>Good design can copy. Attitudes to copying often make a round trip. A novice imitates without knowing it; next he tries consciously to be original; finally, he decides it&#8217;s more important to be right than original.</p>

<p>Unknowing imitation is almost a recipe for bad design. If you don&#8217;t know where your ideas are coming from, you&#8217;re probably imitating an imitator. Raphael so pervaded mid-nineteenth century taste that almost anyone who tried to draw was imitating him, often at several removes. It was this, more than Raphael&#8217;s own work, that bothered the Pre-Raphaelites.</p>

<p>The ambitious are not content to imitate. The second phase in the growth of taste is a conscious attempt at originality.</p>

<p>I think the greatest masters go on to achieve a kind of selflessness. They just want to get the right answer, and if part of the right answer has already been discovered by someone else, that&#8217;s no reason not to use it. They&#8217;re confident enough to take from anyone without feeling that their own vision will be lost in the process.</p>

<p>Good design is often strange. Some of the very best work has an uncanny quality: Euler&#8217;s Formula, Bruegel&#8217;s Hunters in the Snow, the SR-71, Lisp. They&#8217;re not just beautiful, but strangely beautiful.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure why. It may just be my own stupidity. A can-opener must seem miraculous to a dog. Maybe if I were smart enough it would seem the most natural thing in the world that ei*pi = -1. It is after all necessarily true.</p>

<p>Most of the qualities I&#8217;ve mentioned are things that can be cultivated, but I don&#8217;t think it works to cultivate strangeness. The best you can do is not squash it if it starts to appear. Einstein didn&#8217;t try to make relativity strange. He tried to make it true, and the truth turned out to be strange.</p>

<p>At an art school where I once studied, the students wanted most of all to develop a personal style. But if you just try to make good things, you&#8217;ll inevitably do it in a distinctive way, just as each person walks in a distinctive way. Michelangelo was not trying to paint like Michelangelo. He was just trying to paint well; he couldn&#8217;t help painting like Michelangelo.</p>

<p>The only style worth having is the one you can&#8217;t help. And this is especially true for strangeness. There is no shortcut to it. The Northwest Passage that the Mannerists, the Romantics, and two generations of American high school students have searched for does not seem to exist. The only way to get there is to go through good and come out the other side.</p>

<p>Good design happens in chunks. The inhabitants of fifteenth century Florence included Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Fra Angelico, Verrocchio, Botticelli, Leonardo, and Michelangelo. Milan at the time was as big as Florence. How many fifteenth century Milanese artists can you name?</p>

<p>Something was happening in Florence in the fifteenth century. And it can&#8217;t have been heredity, because it isn&#8217;t happening now. You have to assume that whatever inborn ability Leonardo and Michelangelo had, there were people born in Milan with just as much. What happened to the Milanese Leonardo?</p>

<p>There are roughly a thousand times as many people alive in the US right now as lived in Florence during the fifteenth century. A thousand Leonardos and a thousand Michelangelos walk among us. If DNA ruled, we should be greeted daily by artistic marvels. We aren&#8217;t, and the reason is that to make Leonardo you need more than his innate ability. You also need Florence in 1450.</p>

<p>Nothing is more powerful than a community of talented people working on related problems. Genes count for little by comparison: being a genetic Leonardo was not enough to compensate for having been born near Milan instead of Florence. Today we move around more, but great work still comes disproportionately from a few hotspots: the Bauhaus, the Manhattan Project, the New Yorker, Lockheed&#8217;s Skunk Works, Xerox Parc.</p>

<p>At any given time there are a few hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them, and it&#8217;s nearly impossible to do good work yourself if you&#8217;re too far removed from one of these centers. You can push or pull these trends to some extent, but you can&#8217;t break away from them. (Maybe you can, but the Milanese Leonardo couldn&#8217;t.)</p>

<p>Good design is often daring. At every period of history, people have believed things that were just ridiculous, and believed them so strongly that you risked ostracism or even violence by saying otherwise.</p>

<p>If our own time were any different, that would be remarkable. As far as I can tell it isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>This problem afflicts not just every era, but in some degree every field. Much Renaissance art was in its time considered shockingly secular: according to Vasari, Botticelli repented and gave up painting, and Fra Bartolommeo and Lorenzo di Credi actually burned some of their work. Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity offended many contemporary physicists, and was not fully accepted for decades&#8211; in France, not until the 1950s.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s experimental error is tomorrow&#8217;s new theory. If you want to discover great new things, then instead of turning a blind eye to the places where conventional wisdom and truth don&#8217;t quite meet, you should pay particular attention to them.</p>

<p>As a practical matter, I think it&#8217;s easier to see ugliness than to imagine beauty. Most of the people who&#8217;ve made beautiful things seem to have done it by fixing something that they thought ugly. Great work usually seems to happen because someone sees something and thinks, I could do better than that. Giotto saw traditional Byzantine madonnas painted according to a formula that had satisfied everyone for centuries, and to him they looked wooden and unnatural. Copernicus was so troubled by a hack that all his contemporaries could tolerate that he felt there must be a better solution.</p>

<p>Intolerance for ugliness is not in itself enough. You have to understand a field well before you develop a good nose for what needs fixing. You have to do your homework. But as you become expert in a field, you&#8217;ll start to hear little voices saying, What a hack! There must be a better way. Don&#8217;t ignore those voices. Cultivate them. The recipe for great work is: very exacting taste, plus the ability to gratify it.</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>Sullivan actually said &#8220;form ever follows function,&#8221; but I think the usual misquotation is closer to what modernist architects meant.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.paulgrahamcn.com/article/writingandspeaking">Writing and Speaking</a></p>

<p>March 2012</p>

<p>我不是一个很好的演讲者。我经常“嗯”个不停。有时我没了思路, 不得不暂停。我希望我是一个好的演讲者。我也希望我是一个好的写作者, 但我不希望我是同样好的演讲者。我真正想要的是好的想法，这在写作中占的比重比在演讲中占的比重大。</p>

<p>如果要写好，就要有好想法。如果你知道你在说什么，你可以用最平常的话说出来，别人会认为你不错。但是，在演讲中，往往背道而驰：好的想法，只占演讲的一小部分，惊人的小。</p>

<p>我第一次意识到这一点，是几年前的一个会议上。当时另外一位演讲者比我好很多。他让我们所有人都开怀大笑。比较下来，我似乎很尴尬，僵硬。后来我把我的演讲内容放到网上，就像我平常做的那样。在我做这件事的时候，我试图回想那个人的谈话内容是什么样的，突然我意识到他并没有说什么具体内容。</p>

<p>对于知道如何演讲的人来说，也许这已经是很明显的了；但它给我一个提醒，想法在演讲中占的比重比在写作中占的比重小很多。 [1]</p>

<p>几年后，我听到一个人的一段话，他不止是一个比我好的演讲者，更是一个有名的演讲者。他非常棒。所以我决定密切关注他，了解他是怎样做到的。大约十句之后，我发现自己在想：“我不希望是一个好的演讲者。”</p>

<p>成为一个真正的好演讲者与好主意不仅仅是只有正交相似性，很多时候两者背道而驰。例如，当我要演讲时，我通常会先写出来。我知道这是一个错误，我知道进行事先写好的演讲，使得更难与听众交互。获得听众注意力的方式是，要把你所有的注意力都放在他们身上，当你进行事先写好的演讲时，你的注意力就被观众和演讲稿分散了，即使你记住了内容。如果你想与观众交互，最好是除了演讲内容的大纲和即兴的一些句子之外，不要有任何其它东西。但是，如果你这样做，你就没有更多时间思考你要说的每一句话。 现场演讲时，偶尔会有新想法；但一般来说，这不会像写作一样，产生好想法，那时你可以在每一句话上花费任意的时间。</p>

<p>如果你充分排练了一次预先写好的演讲，你就可以渐渐找到即兴演讲的感觉了。演员就是这样。但在流畅与想法之间有一个折中。练习演讲所用的时间，可以用来使演讲更好。演员不会面临这样的诱惑，除非在极少数情况下，他们自己写剧本，但演讲者要自己写剧本。演讲之前我会在一个角落里拿着打印纸，尝试在头脑中排练。但大部分的时间我都在重新写。所有我的讲稿，最终都会布满删除线，或被重写。这当然会让我经常停顿，因为我还没有任何时间来练习刚改的东西。</p>

<p>根据观众的不同，有时候会出现更糟糕的折中。观众喜欢被奉承，喜欢笑话; 他们喜欢激动人心的演讲词汇。当你降低了观众的智商时，好的演讲者就是好的忽悠者。写作中也会有这个问题，但是要比演讲更严重。一名观众要比一位读者要笨。随性演讲者只能花一点点时间来思考所说的话，观众也只有一点点时间来思考他听到的话。观众很容易被周围人的反应所影响，在人和人之间的这种传播很凶猛，就好像低音要比高音更易穿墙一样。每一位观众，都是早期的暴徒，一个好的演讲者利用了这点。那场会议中，那个演讲者的演讲也让我笑了，部分原因是别人都笑了。</p>

<p>所以说演讲没用么？作为思想的来源，肯定逊色于文字的。但是，演讲不是仅仅带来思想。我去听演讲是因为我对演讲者感兴趣。对于类似于总统这样的人，听演讲是接近这些人的最近的交流方式，他没有时间和每个想见他的人单独见面。</p>

<p>演讲也是激励我做事情的方式。所以这么多著名的演讲者都是励志演讲者。这可能是公众演讲的真谛。这也许是最初的目的。听演讲引发的情绪反应是一股强有力的力量。我希望我可以说，那种力量对于疾病也是有好处的，但是我不确。</p>

<p>=================================</p>

<p>Writing and Speaking</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a very good speaker. I say &#8220;um&#8221; a lot. Sometimes I have to pause when I lose my train of thought. I wish I were a better speaker. But I don&#8217;t wish I were a better speaker like I wish I were a better writer. What I really want is to have good ideas, and that&#8217;s a much bigger part of being a good writer than being a good speaker.</p>

<p>Having good ideas is most of writing well. If you know what you&#8217;re talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you&#8217;ll be perceived as having a good style. With speaking it&#8217;s the opposite: having good ideas is an alarmingly small component of being a good speaker.</p>

<p>I first noticed this at a conference several years ago. There was another speaker who was much better than me. He had all of us roaring with laughter. I seemed awkward and halting by comparison. Afterward I put my talk online like I usually do. As I was doing it I tried to imagine what a transcript of the other guy&#8217;s talk would be like, and it was only then I realized he hadn&#8217;t said very much.</p>

<p>Maybe this would have been obvious to someone who knew more about speaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less ideas mattered in speaking than writing. [1]</p>

<p>A few years later I heard a talk by someone who was not merely a better speaker than me, but a famous speaker. Boy was he good. So I decided I&#8217;d pay close attention to what he said, to learn how he did it. After about ten sentences I found myself thinking &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a good speaker.&#8221;</p>

<p>Being a really good speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas, but in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction. For example, when I give a talk I usually write it out beforehand. I know that&#8217;s a mistake; I know delivering a prewritten talk makes it harder to engage with an audience. The way to get the attention of an audience is to give them your full attention, and when you&#8217;re delivering a prewritten talk your attention is always divided between the audience and the talk—even if you&#8217;ve memorized it. If you want to engage an audience it&#8217;s better to start with no more than an outline of what you want to say and ad lib the individual sentences. But if you do that you could spend no more time thinking about each sentence than it takes to say it. [2] Occasionally the stimulation of talking to a live audience makes you think of new things, but in general this is not going to generate ideas as well as writing does, where you can spend as long on each sentence as you want.</p>

<p>If you rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you can get asymptotically close to the sort of engagement you get when speaking ad lib. Actors do. But here again there&#8217;s a tradeoff between smoothness and ideas. All the time you spend practicing a talk, you could instead spend making it better. Actors don&#8217;t face that temptation except in the rare cases where they&#8217;ve written the script, but any speaker does. Before I give a talk I can usually be found sitting in a corner somewhere with a copy printed out on paper, trying to rehearse it in my head. But I always end up spending most of the time rewriting it instead. Every talk I give ends up being given from a manuscript full of things crossed out and rewritten. Which of course makes me um even more, because I haven&#8217;t had any time at all to practice the new bits. [3]</p>

<p>Depending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs than these. Audiences like to be flattered; they like jokes; they like to be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words. As you decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter. That&#8217;s true in writing too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks. Any given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader. Just as a speaker ad libbing can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to say it, a person hearing a talk can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to hear it. Plus people in an audience are always affected by the reactions of those around them, and the reactions that spread from person to person in an audience are disproportionately the more brutish sort, just as low notes travel through walls better than high ones. Every audience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that. Part of the reason I laughed so much at the talk by the good speaker at that conference was that everyone else did. [4]</p>

<p>So are talks useless? They&#8217;re certainly inferior to the written word as a source of ideas. But that&#8217;s not all talks are good for. When I go to a talk, it&#8217;s usually because I&#8217;m interested in the speaker. Listening to a talk is the closest most of us can get to having a conversation with someone like the president, who doesn&#8217;t have time to meet individually with all the people who want to meet him.</p>

<p>Talks are also good at motivating me to do things. It&#8217;s probably no coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as motivational speakers. That may be what public speaking is really for. It&#8217;s probably what it was originally for. The emotional reactions you can elicit with a talk can be a powerful force. I wish I could say that force was more often used for good than ill, but I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>[1] I&#8217;m not talking here about academic talks, which are a different type of thing. While the audience at an academic talk might appreciate a joke, they will (or at least should) make a conscious effort to see what new ideas you&#8217;re presenting.</p>

<p>[2] That&#8217;s the lower bound. In practice you can often do better, because talks are usually about things you&#8217;ve written or talked about before, and when you ad lib you end up reproducing some of those sentences. Like early medieval architecture, impromptu talks are made of spolia. Which feels a bit dishonest, incidentally, because you have to deliver these sentences as if you&#8217;d just thought of them.</p>

<p>[3] Robert Morris points out that there is a way in which practicing talks makes them better: reading a talk out loud can expose awkward parts. I agree and in fact I read most things I write out loud at least once for that reason.</p>

<p>[4] For sufficiently small audiences, it may not be true that being part of an audience makes people dumber. The real decline seems to set in when the audience gets too big for the talk to feel like a conversation—maybe around 10 people.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sam Altman and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.</p>

<p>1993
（本文来自On Lisp的前言）</p>

<p>这是一个永恒的编程原则，程序的函数不要太长。如果某些函数超出了屏幕，那么它会变成一团麻，这很容易掩盖错误，就像大城市很容易掩盖罪犯一样。这种软件将难以阅读，难以测试，难以调试。</p>

<p>按照这一原则，大块程序必须分成小块程序，并且，程序越大，越要分。那么如何划分呢？传统的做法是自上而下设计: 程序的目的是做这样七件事情，所以分成七个子程序。第一个子程序要做四件事情，那么再分四个子例程。这样持续下去，直到整个程序拥有正确的粒度，每部分都足够做一些真正的事情，还要足够小，这样把它理解为一个单元。</p>

<p>然而有经验的lisp程序员使用不同的方式来分割程序。就像自上而下设计一样，他们遵循自下而上设计&#8211;让语言适应问题。在lisp中，你不仅面向语言编写程序，你还会面向程序构建程序。当你在写程序时，你会想，我希望lisp有这样这样的操作符。于是你就把它写好了。之后你意识到使用另外一个新的操作符会简化另外一部分程序的设计，等等。语言和程序彼此交织在一起。就像敌对国家的边界一样，语言和程序的边界也在不停重画，直到山川、河流为止，也就是你的问题的自然边界。最后，你的程序看起来好像就是为这个问题设计的一样。当语言和程序彼此适合后，你的工作也就结束了，代码干净，短小，高效。</p>

<p>值得强调的是，自下而上设计并不只是一种不同的方式。当你自下而上编程时，你会得到一段不一样的程序。不像单一庞大的程序，你会得到一个更大的语言，拥有更多抽象操作符，使用它写了一段短小的程序。不是门梁，而是拱形。</p>

<p>在一段经典的代码中，一旦你抽象出了账簿部分，剩下的就更短了；你构建的语言越高级，从上到下的路程就更短。这带来还能多优势：</p>

<p>通过让语言做更多的工作，自下而上设计会生成更小更灵活的程序。短小的程序并不需要被分成很多组件，越少的组件意味着程序更加易读和修改。更少的组件意味着，组件之间更少的联系，并且，有更少的错误。工业设计师努力减少机器中移动部件的数量，有经验的lisp程序员使用自下而上设计减少程序的大小和复杂性。</p>

<p>自下而上设计促进代码的可重用性。当你写两个或更多程序时，你在第一个程序中写的很多工具也会在接下来的的程序中很有用。一旦你获得了一个很大的工具集，写新的程序往往只需要写原始的lisp程序的一部分努力。</p>

<p>自下而上设计使得程序更容易阅读，这种抽象类型的实例要求读者理解一个通用的操作；功能抽象的程序要求读者理解子程序的用途。</p>

<p>因为这会迫使你经常查找你代码的模式，自下而上设计帮助你理清程序设计的想法。程序中两个不相干的组件在形式上看起来很像的话，你就会注意到这其中的相似性，然后以更简单的方式重新设计程序。</p>

<p>除了lisp，自下而上设计在其他语言中会达到一定的深度。不管什么时候看到库函数，自下而上就会出现。然而在这方面，lisp会给你更大的能力，提高语言在使用lisp方式中的比重&#8211;这样看来，lisp不仅仅是一种不同的编程语言，而是一种完全不同的编程方式。</p>

<p>事实上，这种开发方式，跟适合小团体。同时，它也突破了小团队的局限。在人月神话中，frederick brooks提出，一组程序员的生产力并不会随着人数的增加而线性增加。当团队的人数增加时，个人程序员的生产力就下降了。lisp编程的经历会用更激动人心的方式来叙述：当团队人数减少时，单个程序员的生产力就提升了。相对来说，小团队胜利了，只是因为小。当小团队使用了lisp的技术后，就会彻底完胜。</p>

<p>===============================</p>

<p>programming bottom-up
1993
(This essay is from the introduction to On Lisp. The red text explains the origins of Arc&#8217;s name.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a long-standing principle of programming style that the functional elements of a program should not be too large. If some component of a program grows beyond the stage where it&#8217;s readily comprehensible, it becomes a mass of complexity which conceals errors as easily as a big city conceals fugitives. Such software will be hard to read, hard to test, and hard to debug.</p>

<p>In accordance with this principle, a large program must be divided into pieces, and the larger the program, the more it must be divided. How do you divide a program? The traditional approach is called top-down design: you say &#8220;the purpose of the program is to do these seven things, so I divide it into seven major subroutines. The first subroutine has to do these four things, so it in turn will have four of its own subroutines,&#8221; and so on. This process continues until the whole program has the right level of granularity&#8211; each part large enough to do something substantial, but small enough to be understood as a single unit.</p>

<p>Experienced Lisp programmers divide up their programs differently. As well as top-down design, they follow a principle which could be called bottom-up design&#8211; changing the language to suit the problem. In Lisp, you don&#8217;t just write your program down toward the language, you also build the language up toward your program. As you&#8217;re writing a program you may think &#8220;I wish Lisp had such-and-such an operator.&#8221; So you go and write it. Afterward you realize that using the new operator would simplify the design of another part of the program, and so on. Language and program evolve together. Like the border between two warring states, the boundary between language and program is drawn and redrawn, until eventually it comes to rest along the mountains and rivers, the natural frontiers of your problem. In the end your program will look as if the language had been designed for it. And when language and program fit one another well, you end up with code which is clear, small, and efficient.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn&#8217;t mean just writing the same program in a different order. When you work bottom-up, you usually end up with a different program. Instead of a single, monolithic program, you will get a larger language with more abstract operators, and a smaller program written in it. Instead of a lintel, you&#8217;ll get an arch.</p>

<p>In typical code, once you abstract out the parts which are merely bookkeeping, what&#8217;s left is much shorter; the higher you build up the language, the less distance you will have to travel from the top down to it. This brings several advantages:</p>

<p>By making the language do more of the work, bottom-up design yields programs which are smaller and more agile. A shorter program doesn&#8217;t have to be divided into so many components, and fewer components means programs which are easier to read or modify. Fewer components also means fewer connections between components, and thus less chance for errors there. As industrial designers strive to reduce the number of moving parts in a machine, experienced Lisp programmers use bottom-up design to reduce the size and complexity of their programs.
Bottom-up design promotes code re-use. When you write two or more programs, many of the utilities you wrote for the first program will also be useful in the succeeding ones. Once you&#8217;ve acquired a large substrate of utilities, writing a new program can take only a fraction of the effort it would require if you had to start with raw Lisp.</p>

<p>Bottom-up design makes programs easier to read. An instance of this type of abstraction asks the reader to understand a general-purpose operator; an instance of functional abstraction asks the reader to understand a special-purpose subroutine. [1]</p>

<p>Because it causes you always to be on the lookout for patterns in your code, working bottom-up helps to clarify your ideas about the design of your program. If two distant components of a program are similar in form, you&#8217;ll be led to notice the similarity and perhaps to redesign the program in a simpler way.
Bottom-up design is possible to a certain degree in languages other than Lisp. Whenever you see library functions, bottom-up design is happening. However, Lisp gives you much broader powers in this department, and augmenting the language plays a proportionately larger role in Lisp style&#8211; so much so that Lisp is not just a different language, but a whole different way of programming.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s true that this style of development is better suited to programs which can be written by small groups. However, at the same time, it extends the limits of what can be done by a small group. In The Mythical Man-Month, Frederick Brooks proposed that the productivity of a group of programmers does not grow linearly with its size. As the size of the group increases, the productivity of individual programmers goes down. The experience of Lisp programming suggests a more cheerful way to phrase this law: as the size of the group decreases, the productivity of individual programmers goes up. A small group wins, relatively speaking, simply because it&#8217;s smaller. When a small group also takes advantage of the techniques that Lisp makes possible, it can win outright.</p>

<p>[1] &#8220;But no one can read the program without understanding all your new utilities.&#8221; To see why such statements are usually mistaken, see Section 4.8.</p>

<p>(本文取自2001年在 Franz 开发者大会的一篇演讲)</p>

<p>1995年夏天，朋友Rober Morris 和我创办了Viaweb，我们计划写一个让用户建立在线商店的软件。当时新颖的是，软件运行在我们的服务器上，使用普通的网页作为界面。</p>

<p>当然，当时可能很多人有同样的想法。但是据我所知，Viaweb是第一个基于网页的。对于我们来说，这是一个非常新颖的主意，之后我们给公司起名：Viaweb。因为我们的软件是通过网站，而不是运行在你的电脑桌面上。</p>

<p>软件另一点不寻常的地方是，我们使用一个叫做Lisp的语言编写。这是最早用Lisp写的大型终端软件之一，在此之前，Lisp主要用在大学和研究室里。</p>

<p>The Secret Weapon
秘密武器</p>

<p>Eric Raymond写过一篇文章，“怎样成为黑客”，其中，他告诉将来的黑客应该学习什么编程语言。他建议从python或者java开始，因为它们很简单。高级黑客还应当学习c，来理解Unix；学习Perl，来管理系统和CGI。最后，真正的高级黑客需要考虑学习Lisp：</p>

<p>“lisp值得学习，当你最终掌握它时，你会获得深厚的启示经历；这段经历会让你今后成为一个更好的程序员，即使以后不会常常用到它。“</p>

<p>你会听到相同的学习拉丁语的原因。拉丁语不会给你一份工作，除非要当个古希腊文化教授，但是它能提升你的思想，让你成为一个更好的使用其它语言的作家，比如英语。</p>

<p>但是这个比喻在此并不适用。之所以学习拉丁语不能给你一份工作，是因为没人使用。如果你用它写作，没人能理解。但是Lisp是一个计算机的语言，计算机可以理解程序员告知它的任何语言。</p>

<p>但是，就像他说的，假如Lisp能让你成为一个更好的程序员，那你为什么不会去用它？假如一根画笔能让某人成为一个更好的画家，他应该会用这根画笔去画他所有的作品，不是吗？我不是想在这讽刺Eric Raymond。总体来说，他的建议是很好的。只是他对Lisp的看法是传统的观点，而这个观点有自相矛盾的地方，即Lisp能让你成为一个更好的程序员，但是你不会去使用它。</p>

<p>为什么不用？本质上，编程语言只是工具而已。如果Lisp确实能写出更好的程序，你当然应该用它；如果它不能，那没人会用它。</p>

<p>这不仅仅是一个理论问题。软件业是个竞争很激烈的行业，优胜劣汰。在其他条件一样的情况下，软件写的又快又好的公司，就能打败他的竞争对手。当你创业的时候，这种感觉是非常强烈的。要么得到所有，要么一无所有。不是富豪，就是穷光蛋。在创业起初，如果选错了技术，你的竞争对手就会干掉你。</p>

<p>Robert和我都很了解Lisp，我们找不到任何理由不去相信自己的直觉。其他人都用C++或者Perl，但那与我们无关。如果你准备和他们一样，那你一定在用Windows。从技术角度出发，你得忽略其他人的普遍做法，而只去思考最佳方案。</p>

<p>这更加适用于创业。大公司，可以做其他大公司都在做的事。但是创业公司不能这样。很多人没意识到这点，即使是创业者。</p>

<p>大企业平均每年增长10%的利润。所以如果你在管理大企业，那么就做一般大公司做的事情，只能期望一个一般的表现——每年10%左右的增长。</p>

<p>当然，这对创业者来说，也是一样。假如你和其他创业公司做一样的事情，你也只能有一般的表现。问题是，那样的表现意味着你会破产。创业公司的存活率低于50%。所以，如果你将要创业，最好另辟蹊径，否则，你就会陷入困境。</p>

<p>在1995年，我们明白一些其他竞争者不了解，即使现在也很少人理解的东西：写一个只会运行在自己的服务器上的软件时，你可以用任何你喜欢的语言。而当写个人桌面软件时，一种强烈的偏见是，你必须使用和操作系统一样的语言。10年前，编写应用程序意味着用C。但是基于网络的软件，特别是当你拥有操作系统和语言的源码时，你可以使用任何语言。</p>

<p>尽管如此，这种新的自由却是一把双刃剑。你可以使用任何语言，就得好好想想用哪种。那些不愿意冒险作出改变的公司会发现，他们的竞争对手可不一样。</p>

<p>如果你可以使用任何语言，你会选哪个？我们选择Lisp。首先，很明显，快速开发在这个市场是很重要的。我们都是白手起家，所以能早于竞争对手推出新功能就会有很大的优势。我们知道Lisp是一种编写软件非常快的语言，而基于服务器的软件又放大了这种影响，因为你可以在编写完成的第一时间发布你的软件。</p>

<p>如果其他公司不想用Lisp，那正好。这也许会让我们处于技术的边缘，我们需要任何可以得到的帮助。当我们创办Viaweb时，我们对毫无商业经验。我们对市场，雇佣员工，赚钱，吸引顾客都一无所知。我们俩也都没实际工作过，只擅长编写软件，我们希望这能拯救我们。我们要利用一切优势。</p>

<p>你可以说使用Lisp是一次实验。我们的设想是，假如用Lisp写软件，那就能比竞争对手更快的完成软件，能作对手作不到的事。因为Lisp的高级特性，我们不需要一个大的开发团队，所以花费也更少。如果能这样，我们就能提供更好的产品，或者更低的价格，仍然可以盈利。逐渐的，我们就能得到所有的客户，而对手们什么都得不到，直到退出这个行业。当然，这就是我们所期望的。</p>

<p>实验的结果如何？让人吃惊的是，成功了。一开始 我们有很多竞争对手，大约2，30个，但是他们的软件都无法和我们的相比。我们有一个所见即所得的在线商店创建程序，运行在服务器上，但是和个人桌面应用 程序没什么两样。竞争对手们使用CGI脚本，而我们总是在功能上遥遥领先。有时候，对手会拼命宣传我们没有的功能。但是Lisp大大缩短了开发周期，以至 于我们能在1到2天之内就复制一个竞争对手刚刚发布的新功能。当记者报道他们新发布的版本的时候，我们也有了同样的功能。</p>

<p>在竞争对手看来，我们似乎有某种秘密武器——我们能解密他们的Enigma机器或者别的东西。事实上，我们确实有一个秘密武器，但是比他们想象的简单得多。没有人泄露他们的秘密给我们，我们只是能以别人意想不到的速度开发软件。</p>

<p>我9岁的时候，看过Frederick Forsyth写的《刺杀戴高乐》。主角是一个被雇佣来刺杀法国总统的刺客。那个刺客需要越过警察，到一个可以俯瞰总统行走路径的旅馆。他从警察正面走过，伪装成一个杵着拐杖的老头，没有人对他起疑心。</p>

<p>我们的秘密武器也是这样。我们用一个充满了怪异括号，古怪的人工智能语言编写软件。很多年前，我对Lisp的这个特点感到厌烦，但是它现在却成了我们的优势。商业上，最强的技术优势就是，你用着竞争者不懂的技术。商业，和打仗一样，出奇才能制胜。</p>

<p>所 以，有点惭愧的说，当我们在作Viaweb的时候，从未在公开场合提到Lisp。我们从来没有对媒体提到它，如果你在我们网站上搜索Lisp，只会找到2 本我的藏书。这不奇怪，创业公司透露给它的竞争对手的信息越少越好。如果他们不知道，或者不关心我们的软件用什么写的，那正合我意。[2]</p>

<p>最 了解我们技术的是客户们。他们不关心Viaweb是用什么写的，只是知道它很好用。他们可以用Viaweb几分钟就建好一个漂亮的在线商店，所以，一传 十，十传百，我们有了越来越多的客户。1996年底，我们的在线商店是70个左右。1997年年底，我们有了500个。6个月后，当Yahoo收购我们 时，有1070个用户。今天，作为Yahoo Store，这个软件依旧统治着市场。也是Yahoo盈利很多的商品之一，而用它建立的商店，则是Yahoo Shopping的基础。我1999年离开Yahoo，所以不知道他们现在有多少用户了，但是最近一次听说是20000。</p>

<p>The Blub Paradox
Blub矛盾原则</p>

<p>Lisp 到底强在哪里？如果Lisp这么强大，为什么这么少人用？听起来是个复杂的问题，但是答案很直接：Lisp不仅因为，只有喜欢它的人才能看到它的强大，还 因为它是你可以使用的最强大的语言。不是所有人都用Lisp的原因是，编程语言不只是技术，还包括头脑的习惯，而这些改变起来都很缓慢。当然，这里需要解 释一下。</p>

<p>我从一个非常有争议的声明开始说起：编程语言的威力是不一样的</p>

<p>至少，大部分人会同意，高级语言比机器语言强大。如今，很多程序员都明白，用机器语言写程序很傻。你应该用高级语言，让编译器去把它转换成机器语言。这个观点甚至被用在硬件上了：20世纪80年代以来，汇编指令集开始为编译器设计，而不是为程序员。</p>

<p>所有人都知道手写机器语言编写程序是错误的。但很多人没理解另一个通用的观点：如果你可以选择许多种语言，他们其他地方都一样，那只有用最有威力的才是唯一正确的选择。[3]</p>

<p>这 个观点有很多例外。如果你需要写一个和某个语言写的程序工作很接近的程序，也许用同样的语言写这个程序会是个不错的选择；如果你需要写一个只作很简单的， 比如数字，位处理，你也许应该用抽象程度不那么高的语言，特别是当它能够运行得更快的时候；如果你只想写一个临时程序，也许你该用对这个任务来说，有最佳 的函数库的语言。但是，总的说来，对于应用程序，你应该能使用最有威力（最有效率）的语言。用别的语言都是个错误，因为那样几乎等于，虽然夸哦张了点，是 在用机器语言编程。</p>

<p>你们都知道机器语言是很低级的。但是，以社会上的普遍观点来说，高级语言通常都被认为是差不多的，其实不然。从技术上说，“高级语言”并不是一个精确的定义，而在低级语言和高级语言之间也没有明确的分界线。根据抽象程度的高低，编程语言形成了一个有序的梯队列表。[4]</p>

<p>看看Cobol。Cobol是一个高级语言，因为它需要编译成机器语言执行。但是会有人认真的说Cobol的威力和，比如Python，是一样的吗？它显然比Python更接近机器语言。</p>

<p>那 么Perl 4呢？从Perl 4到Perl 5，词法闭包添加了进来。大多数Perl黑客会同意，Perl 5比Perl 4更强大。一旦你也这么觉得，那就意味着你承认，一种高级语言可以比另一种更强大。除非特殊情况，接下来你自然会想要去用能得到的，最强大的语言。</p>

<p>但是，这个想法很少会和上述结论吻合。岁月流逝，程序员极少积极的更换使用的语言。人们一旦习惯使用某种语言，他们就会满足现状。</p>

<p>程序员和他们喜爱的语言特别亲近，而我也不想伤害任何人的情感。因此，为了说明这个观点，我将使用一个假设的语言：Blub。Blub处于语言抽象程度列表的中间位置，它不是最强大的语言，但是比Cobol或者机器语言要强大。</p>

<p>而事实上，我们的Blub程序员2者都不会用。他当然不会想要用机器语言写程序，那是编译器干的事。至于Cobol，他不了解怎么用它解决问题，因为它没有X功能(设想的某种功能)。</p>

<p>我 们假设的Blub程序员如果从语言抽象程度列表往下看，他能知道自己是在往下看。比Blub弱的语言明显的弱很多，因为缺少他已经习惯的一些功能。但是， 假如我们的Blub程序员从相反的方向去看，他却不会觉得自己是在往上看。因为他看到的都是古怪的语言。他也许会认为那都是和Blub差不多的语言，只是 长相稀奇古怪而已。Blub对他来说足够了，因为他是在用Blub思考。</p>

<p>当我们从另外一个，使用更高级的语言的程序员的角度来看时，又会如何？你用Blub能作什么呢？它连Y功能都没有。</p>

<p>简 单的说，只有理解最强大语言的程序员，才会对整个列表的高级语言的威力，有一个全面的了解。（这也许就是Eric Raymond说的，Lisp会让你成为一个更好的程序员的原因。）你不能相信其他人的看法，因为Blub矛盾原则：他们对自己习惯的语言感到满足，因为 这符合他们思考程序的方式。</p>

<p>我自己的经历证明了这点，当时我还在高中用Basic写程序时。那种语言甚至不支持递归。很难想象不用递归来写程，但是我当时不这么觉得。我以Basic的方式思考，成了Basic的专家，掌握了所有我能了解到的。</p>

<p>Eric Raymond推荐给黑客的5种语言，位于语言威力列表中不同的位置，而他们之间的比较则是个容易引起争吵的话题。我想说的是，我觉得Lisp是在最顶层 的。为了证明这个观点，我会指出一个其他四种语言没有的特性。他们甚至不支持宏(Macro)，我能用它能作什么呢？[5]</p>

<p>许多语言都一 个被叫做“宏”的东西，但是Lisp的宏是不同的。信不信由你，它们作的都是和括号相关的。Lisp的设计者并不是只是为了与众不同才使用那么多括号。对 Blub程序员来说，Lisp的代码看起来很古怪。但是，这些括号的出现是有原因的。这使得Lisp从外表上看起来，和其他语言有本质的不同。</p>

<p>Lisp代码是由Lisp数据对象组成的。别的语言一般会设计成：源文件包含字符，字符串是则是该语言所支持的数据类型之一。而当解析器读取Lisp代码时，你会发现Lisp是由你可以遍历的数据结构组成的。</p>

<p>如 果你明白编译原理，就会可以理解Lisp的这种奇怪的语法，或者说没有语法的语法。其他语言会被编译器解析成解析树，而你在Lisp中，就是用这种解析树 的结构写程序。这些解析树对你的程序来说是可读的，因此就可以写程序来维护它们。在Lisp里，这样的程序称为宏。它们是可以生成程序的程序。</p>

<p>可 以生成程序的程序？什么时候会需要这么作？如果你用Cobol的方式思考，这种需求并不常见；如果用Lisp的方式思考，你会经常想要这么作。这里如果能 给出一个强大的宏的例子，也许会比较方便阐明。但是对一个不懂Lisp的人来说，会觉得那像是在胡扯，我没办法把需要让你理解宏的预备知识在这里说清楚。 在《Ansi Common Lisp》这本书里，我已经很快的引导读者理解所有的东西，尽管如此，在160页之前，我都没有提到宏。</p>

<p>我 能给出一个有说服力的例子。Viaweb编辑器的源码有20％－25％是宏。宏比普通的Lisp函数要难写，在不需要的地方使用也是个坏习惯。所以，宏存 在于那里是因为它必须存在。这就是说，在这个程序里，有20％－25％的部分是你用别的语言难以实现的。Blub程序员可能会对我声称的，Lisp如此神 气的威力，感到怀疑和好奇。我们写这些代码不是只给自己看看而已。我们是个很小的创业公司，所以尽最大的力在我们和竞争者之间构筑了一道技术的壁垒。</p>

<p>感到疑惑的人也许会想，你说的这些东西都有什么关联？我们的一大段代码，是在作用别的语言很难实现的工作，这样，我们就能人所不能。也许这就是关键所在，我鼓励你顺着这个角度去思考。也许这个杵着拐杖的老头可不简单哦。</p>

<p>Aikido for Startups
创业之道</p>

<p>我 不指望说服所有的人(大于25岁)都去学Lisp。这篇文章的目的不是改变别人的想法，而是给那些对Lisp有兴趣的人信心。他们已经知道Lisp是一个 强大的语言，但是因为它没有被广泛的使用而感到担忧。在竞赛中，这是一种优势。因为你的竞争对手用不了它，所以Lisp的优势还被放大了。</p>

<p>如 果你想要用Lisp创业，不需要因为它不被广泛的理解而感到担忧。你应该觉得那样很好。人们普遍对于他们当前使用的语言很满意。计算机硬件的发展速度比人 们习惯的改变速度快得多，实际编程比处理器要落后10到20年。像在MIT，他们早在20世纪60年代就开始用高级语言写程序了，而很多公司在80年代之 前都还在用机器语言。我敢打赌，处理器换到RISC指令集时，相当大一部分用机器语言写代码的人失了业。</p>

<p>通常说来，技术更新是很快 的。但是编程语言不一样：编程不止是技术，也是程序员思维的方式。他们是半技术，半宗教信仰的东西。[6]所以，流行的语言，即大部分程序员使用的语言， 发展像冰山一样缓慢。垃圾回收，大约20世纪60年代由Lisp引入，现在普遍被认为是个好东西；运行时输入(runtime typing)，同上，现在开始流行起来；词法闭包，20世纪70年代由Lisp引入，现在少量的运用在雷达技术上。宏，20世纪60年代由Lisp引 入，现在还是未开垦的领域。</p>

<p>当然，流行的语言有强大的势力，我不是想让你去对抗。相反，像合气道(译者：日本的一种竞技项目)一样，你可以用它来对付竞争对手。</p>

<p>如果你在一家大公司工作，也许没那么容易。说服一个头发油光锃亮的老板是个艰难的任务，而他也许正好读到某篇报道，说某某语言，就像20年前的Ada一样，将要占领这个行业。但假如你在创业公司工作，也没有那种油光锃亮的老板，那就好好利用Blub矛盾原则提到的优势，就像我们一样：你可以使用，那些坚持使用流行语言的竞争对手，永远无法匹敌的技术。</p>

<p>如果你在一个创业公司工作，这里有一些可用于评估对手的提示：查看他们的招聘岗位。他们网站上的其他东西也许会是股票照片，或者之类的。但是职位需求肯定会反映出他们要什么样的员工，否则无法得到想要的候选人。</p>

<p>我在Viaweb工作的几年里，查看过很多的职位描述。每个月都会有新的竞争者冒出来。我首先作的通常是，看看他们是否有在线的demo，然后去查看他们的招聘信息。很多年之后，我可以知道那些公司需要注意，而那些不需要。最安全的是那些需要Oracle经验的，你不需要担心他们。如果他们需要C++或者 java开发者，你同样不需要担心。如果他们想要Perl或者Python程序员，那就得小心了——看起来这家公司是搞技术的，至少，他们是真的黑客创办 的。如果看到招聘Lisp黑客的信息，我就会非常担心。</p>

<p>Notes
注释</p>

<p>[1]起初Viaweb有2部分：编辑器，用Lisp编写的，用户们用它来建立站点；请求处理系统，用C编写，处理请求。初版基本上是Lisp，因为请求处理系统很小。后来我们增加了2个模块，用C写的一个图像生成器，用Perl写的一个后台管理系统。</p>

<p>2003年1月，Yahoo发布了用C++和Perl写的新版本。很难说这个程序是否还是Lisp写的，因为要把它移植到C++，他们需要写一个Lisp解释器：构建页面模板的源文件，就我所知，还是Lisp代码。</p>

<p>[2]Rober Morris说我不需要保密，因为即使竞争者们知道我们用Lisp，他们也不会理解为什么：“假如他们有那么聪明的话，他们早就用Lisp编程了。“</p>

<p>[3] 因为图灵等价，所以很多语言被认为威力差不多，但是这不是程序员关心的。（没人想要写一个图灵机）。NB的程序员到底关心什么不好说，一种可能的解释是： 那些只能通过为更强大语言写一个解释器，才能在较弱的语言中获得的功能。如果语言A有一个操作符可以把字串中的空格去掉，而语言B没这个，那并不意味只A 就更强大。因为你大可在B里写一个类似的函数。但是假如A支持，比如递归，而B不支持，那可就不是你写一个函数库可以解决的问题了。</p>

<p>[4]呆头呆脑和断章取义的人注意：重要的是这里存在一个抽象的顺序，它到底长什么形状并不重要。</p>

<p>[5]把宏作为一个单独的功能列出来，有些不妥。实际上，他们的功效需要和其他的Lisp功能，比如词法闭包，变参等，一起才能发挥最大作用。</p>

<p>[6]结果是，对编程语言的比较要么是以“宗教战争”的形式，要么就像本科教材里面那样尽量中立的表述。对于看重和平，明哲保身的人来说，他们会避免这个话题。但是这个问题其实只是半宗教的：有些东西还是值得你去学习，特别是当你想要设计新语言的时候。</p>

<p>=================================================
Beating The Averages</p>

<p>Want to start a startup? Get funded by Y Combinator.</p>

<p>(This article is derived from a talk given at the 2001 Franz Developer Symposium.)</p>

<p>In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I started a startup called Viaweb. Our plan was to write software that would let end users build online stores. What was novel about this software, at the time, was that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages as the interface.</p>

<p>A lot of people could have been having this idea at the same time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb was the first Web-based application. It seemed such a novel idea to us that we named the company after it: Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web, instead of running on your desktop computer.</p>

<p>Another unusual thing about this software was that it was written primarily in a programming language called Lisp. It was one of the first big end-user applications to be written in Lisp, which up till then had been used mostly in universities and research labs. [1]</p>

<p>The Secret Weapon</p>

<p>Eric Raymond has written an essay called &#8220;How to Become a Hacker,&#8221; and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what languages they should learn. He suggests starting with Python and Java, because they are easy to learn. The serious hacker will also want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system administration and cgi scripts. Finally, the truly serious hacker should consider learning Lisp:</p>

<p>Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.</p>

<p>This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin. It won&#8217;t get you a job, except perhaps as a classics professor, but it will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages you do want to use, like English.</p>

<p>But wait a minute. This metaphor doesn&#8217;t stretch that far. The reason Latin won&#8217;t get you a job is that no one speaks it. If you write in Latin, no one can understand you. But Lisp is a computer language, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer, tell them to.</p>

<p>So if Lisp makes you a better programmer, like he says, why wouldn&#8217;t you want to use it? If a painter were offered a brush that would make him a better painter, it seems to me that he would want to use it in all his paintings, wouldn&#8217;t he? I&#8217;m not trying to make fun of Eric Raymond here. On the whole, his advice is good. What he says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom. But there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom: Lisp will make you a better programmer, and yet you won&#8217;t use it.</p>

<p>Why not? Programming languages are just tools, after all. If Lisp really does yield better programs, you should use it. And if it doesn&#8217;t, then who needs it?</p>

<p>This is not just a theoretical question. Software is a very competitive business, prone to natural monopolies. A company that gets software written faster and better will, all other things being equal, put its competitors out of business. And when you&#8217;re starting a startup, you feel this very keenly. Startups tend to be an all or nothing proposition. You either get rich, or you get nothing. In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your competitors will crush you.</p>

<p>Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn&#8217;t see any reason not to trust our instincts and go with Lisp. We knew that everyone else was writing their software in C++ or Perl. But we also knew that that didn&#8217;t mean anything. If you chose technology that way, you&#8217;d be running Windows. When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will work the best.</p>

<p>This is especially true in a startup. In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing. But a startup can&#8217;t do what all the other startups do. I don&#8217;t think a lot of people realize this, even in startups.</p>

<p>The average big company grows at about ten percent a year. So if you&#8217;re running a big company and you do everything the way the average big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the average big company&#8211; that is, to grow about ten percent a year.</p>

<p>The same thing will happen if you&#8217;re running a startup, of course. If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should expect average performance. The problem here is, average performance means that you&#8217;ll go out of business. The survival rate for startups is way less than fifty percent. So if you&#8217;re running a startup, you had better be doing something odd. If not, you&#8217;re in trouble.</p>

<p>Back in 1995, we knew something that I don&#8217;t think our competitors understood, and few understand even now: when you&#8217;re writing software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use any language you want. When you&#8217;re writing desktop software, there&#8217;s a strong bias toward writing applications in the same language as the operating system. Ten years ago, writing applications meant writing applications in C. But with Web-based software, especially when you have the source code of both the language and the operating system, you can use whatever language you want.</p>

<p>This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however. Now that you can use any language, you have to think about which one to use. Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that their competitors do not.</p>

<p>If you can use any language, which do you use? We chose Lisp. For one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would be important in this market. We were all starting from scratch, so a company that could get new features done before its competitors would have a big advantage. We knew Lisp was a really good language for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify the effect of rapid development, because you can release software the minute it&#8217;s done.</p>

<p>If other companies didn&#8217;t want to use Lisp, so much the better. It might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the help we could get. When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in business. We didn&#8217;t know anything about marketing, or hiring people, or raising money, or getting customers. Neither of us had ever even had what you would call a real job. The only thing we were good at was writing software. We hoped that would save us. Any advantage we could get in the software department, we would take.</p>

<p>So you could say that using Lisp was an experiment. Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we&#8217;d be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they couldn&#8217;t do. And because Lisp was so high-level, we wouldn&#8217;t need a big development team, so our costs would be lower. If this were so, we could offer a better product for less money, and still make a profit. We would end up getting all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually go out of business. That was what we hoped would happen, anyway.</p>

<p>What were the results of this experiment? Somewhat surprisingly, it worked. We eventually had many competitors, on the order of twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete with ours. We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the server and yet felt like a desktop application. Our competitors had cgi scripts. And we were always far ahead of them in features. Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce features that we didn&#8217;t have. But with Lisp our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release. By the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling us, we would have the new feature too.</p>

<p>It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon&#8211; that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or something. In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler than they realized. No one was leaking news of their features to us. We were just able to develop software faster than anyone thought possible.</p>

<p>When I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy of The Day of the Jackal, by Frederick Forsyth. The main character is an assassin who is hired to kill the president of France. The assassin has to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooks the president&#8217;s route. He walks right by them, dressed up as an old man on crutches, and they never suspect him.</p>

<p>Our secret weapon was similar. We wrote our software in a weird AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses. For years it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way. But now it worked to our advantage. In business, there is nothing more valuable than a technical advantage your competitors don&#8217;t understand. In business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.</p>

<p>And so, I&#8217;m a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything publicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb. We never mentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web site, all you&#8217;d find were the titles of two books in my bio. This was no accident. A startup should give its competitors as little information as possible. If they didn&#8217;t know what language our software was written in, or didn&#8217;t care, I wanted to keep it that way.[2]</p>

<p>The people who understood our technology best were the customers. They didn&#8217;t care what language Viaweb was written in either, but they noticed that it worked really well. It let them build great looking online stores literally in minutes. And so, by word of mouth mostly, we got more and more users. By the end of 1996 we had about 70 stores online. At the end of 1997 we had 500. Six months later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users. Today, as Yahoo Store, this software continues to dominate its market. It&#8217;s one of the more profitable pieces of Yahoo, and the stores built with it are the foundation of Yahoo Shopping. I left Yahoo in 1999, so I don&#8217;t know exactly how many users they have now, but the last I heard there were about 20,000.</p>

<p>The Blub Paradox</p>

<p>What&#8217;s so great about Lisp? And if Lisp is so great, why doesn&#8217;t everyone use it? These sound like rhetorical questions, but actually they have straightforward answers. Lisp is so great not because of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is simply the most powerful language available. And the reason everyone doesn&#8217;t use it is that programming languages are not merely technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes slower. Of course, both these answers need explaining.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll begin with a shockingly controversial statement: programming languages vary in power.</p>

<p>Few would dispute, at least, that high level languages are more powerful than machine language. Most programmers today would agree that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language. Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a compiler translate it into machine language for you. This idea is even built into the hardware now: since the 1980s, instruction sets have been designed for compilers rather than human programmers.</p>

<p>Everyone knows it&#8217;s a mistake to write your whole program by hand in machine language. What&#8217;s less often understood is that there is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one. [3]</p>

<p>There are many exceptions to this rule. If you&#8217;re writing a program that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the same language. If you&#8217;re writing a program that only has to do something very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation, you may as well use a less abstract language, especially since it may be slightly faster. And if you&#8217;re writing a short, throwaway program, you may be better off just using whatever language has the best library functions for the task. But in general, for application software, you want to be using the most powerful (reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything else is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a lesser degree, as programming in machine language.</p>

<p>You can see that machine language is very low level. But, at least as a kind of social convention, high-level languages are often all treated as equivalent. They&#8217;re not. Technically the term &#8220;high-level language&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean anything very definite. There&#8217;s no dividing line with machine languages on one side and all the high-level languages on the other. Languages fall along a continuum [4] of abstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine languages, which themselves vary in power.</p>

<p>Consider Cobol. Cobol is a high-level language, in the sense that it gets compiled into machine language. Would anyone seriously argue that Cobol is equivalent in power to, say, Python? It&#8217;s probably closer to machine language than Python.</p>

<p>Or how about Perl 4? Between Perl 4 and Perl 5, lexical closures got added to the language. Most Perl hackers would agree that Perl 5 is more powerful than Perl 4. But once you&#8217;ve admitted that, you&#8217;ve admitted that one high level language can be more powerful than another. And it follows inexorably that, except in special cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.</p>

<p>This idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though. After a certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily. Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider just good enough.</p>

<p>Programmers get very attached to their favorite languages, and I don&#8217;t want to hurt anyone&#8217;s feelings, so to explain this point I&#8217;m going to use a hypothetical language called Blub. Blub falls right in the middle of the abstractness continuum. It is not the most powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine language.</p>

<p>And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn&#8217;t use either of them. Of course he wouldn&#8217;t program in machine language. That&#8217;s what compilers are for. And as for Cobol, he doesn&#8217;t know how anyone can get anything done with it. It doesn&#8217;t even have x (Blub feature of your choice).</p>

<p>As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum, he knows he&#8217;s looking down. Languages less powerful than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they&#8217;re missing some feature he&#8217;s used to. But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn&#8217;t realize he&#8217;s looking up. What he sees are merely weird languages. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.</p>

<p>When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that he in turn looks down upon Blub. How can you get anything done in Blub? It doesn&#8217;t even have y.</p>

<p>By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the differences in power between the various languages are those who understand the most powerful one. (This is probably what Eric Raymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.) You can&#8217;t trust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox: they&#8217;re satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs.</p>

<p>I know this from my own experience, as a high school kid writing programs in Basic. That language didn&#8217;t even support recursion. It&#8217;s hard to imagine writing programs without using recursion, but I didn&#8217;t miss it at the time. I thought in Basic. And I was a whiz at it. Master of all I surveyed.</p>

<p>The five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall at various points on the power continuum. Where they fall relative to one another is a sensitive topic. What I will say is that I think Lisp is at the top. And to support this claim I&#8217;ll tell you about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other four languages. How can you get anything done in them, I think, without macros? [5]</p>

<p>Many languages have something called a macro. But Lisp macros are unique. And believe it or not, what they do is related to the parentheses. The designers of Lisp didn&#8217;t put all those parentheses in the language just to be different. To the Blub programmer, Lisp code looks weird. But those parentheses are there for a reason. They are the outward evidence of a fundamental difference between Lisp and other languages.</p>

<p>Lisp code is made out of Lisp data objects. And not in the trivial sense that the source files contain characters, and strings are one of the data types supported by the language. Lisp code, after it&#8217;s read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can traverse.</p>

<p>If you understand how compilers work, what&#8217;s really going on is not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no syntax. You write programs in the parse trees that get generated within the compiler when other languages are parsed. But these parse trees are fully accessible to your programs. You can write programs that manipulate them. In Lisp, these programs are called macros. They are programs that write programs.</p>

<p>Programs that write programs? When would you ever want to do that? Not very often, if you think in Cobol. All the time, if you think in Lisp. It would be convenient here if I could give an example of a powerful macro, and say there! how about that? But if I did, it would just look like gibberish to someone who didn&#8217;t know Lisp; there isn&#8217;t room here to explain everything you&#8217;d need to know to understand what it meant. In Ansi Common Lisp I tried to move things along as fast as I could, and even so I didn&#8217;t get to macros until page 160.</p>

<p>But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing. The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25% macros. Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions, and it&#8217;s considered to be bad style to use them when they&#8217;re not necessary. So every macro in that code is there because it has to be. What that means is that at least 20-25% of the code in this program is doing things that you can&#8217;t easily do in any other language. However skeptical the Blub programmer might be about my claims for the mysterious powers of Lisp, this ought to make him curious. We weren&#8217;t writing this code for our own amusement. We were a tiny startup, programming as hard as we could in order to put technical barriers between us and our competitors.</p>

<p>A suspicious person might begin to wonder if there was some correlation here. A big chunk of our code was doing things that are very hard to do in other languages. The resulting software did things our competitors&#8217; software couldn&#8217;t do. Maybe there was some kind of connection. I encourage you to follow that thread. There may be more to that old man hobbling along on his crutches than meets the eye.</p>

<p>Aikido for Startups</p>

<p>But I don&#8217;t expect to convince anyone (over 25) to go out and learn Lisp. The purpose of this article is not to change anyone&#8217;s mind, but to reassure people already interested in using Lisp&#8211; people who know that Lisp is a powerful language, but worry because it isn&#8217;t widely used. In a competitive situation, that&#8217;s an advantage. Lisp&#8217;s power is multiplied by the fact that your competitors don&#8217;t get it.</p>

<p>If you think of using Lisp in a startup, you shouldn&#8217;t worry that it isn&#8217;t widely understood. You should hope that it stays that way. And it&#8217;s likely to. It&#8217;s the nature of programming languages to make most people satisfied with whatever they currently use. Computer hardware changes so much faster than personal habits that programming practice is usually ten to twenty years behind the processor. At places like MIT they were writing programs in high-level languages in the early 1960s, but many companies continued to write code in machine language well into the 1980s. I bet a lot of people continued to write machine language until the processor, like a bartender eager to close up and go home, finally kicked them out by switching to a risc instruction set.</p>

<p>Ordinarily technology changes fast. But programming languages are different: programming languages are not just technology, but what programmers think in. They&#8217;re half technology and half religion.[6] And so the median language, meaning whatever language the median programmer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg. Garbage collection, introduced by Lisp in about 1960, is now widely considered to be a good thing. Runtime typing, ditto, is growing in popularity. Lexical closures, introduced by Lisp in the early 1970s, are now, just barely, on the radar screen. Macros, introduced by Lisp in the mid 1960s, are still terra incognita.</p>

<p>Obviously, the median language has enormous momentum. I&#8217;m not proposing that you can fight this powerful force. What I&#8217;m proposing is exactly the opposite: that, like a practitioner of Aikido, you can use it against your opponents.</p>

<p>If you work for a big company, this may not be easy. You will have a hard time convincing the pointy-haired boss to let you build things in Lisp, when he has just read in the paper that some other language is poised, like Ada was twenty years ago, to take over the world. But if you work for a startup that doesn&#8217;t have pointy-haired bosses yet, you can, like we did, turn the Blub paradox to your advantage: you can use technology that your competitors, glued immovably to the median language, will never be able to match.</p>

<p>If you ever do find yourself working for a startup, here&#8217;s a handy tip for evaluating competitors. Read their job listings. Everything else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent, but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or they&#8217;ll get the wrong candidates.</p>

<p>During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions. A new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month or so. The first thing I would do, after checking to see if they had a live online demo, was look at their job listings. After a couple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about and which not to. The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions had, the less dangerous the company was. The safest kind were the ones that wanted Oracle experience. You never had to worry about those. You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java developers. If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening&#8211; that&#8217;s starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers. If I had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would have been really worried.</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>[1] Viaweb at first had two parts: the editor, written in Lisp, which people used to build their sites, and the ordering system, written in C, which handled orders. The first version was mostly Lisp, because the ordering system was small. Later we added two more modules, an image generator written in C, and a back-office manager written mostly in Perl.</p>

<p>In January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor written in C++ and Perl. It&#8217;s hard to say whether the program is no longer written in Lisp, though, because to translate this program into C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source files of all the page-generating templates are still, as far as I know, Lisp code. (See Greenspun&#8217;s Tenth Rule.)</p>

<p>[2] Robert Morris says that I didn&#8217;t need to be secretive, because even if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn&#8217;t have understood why: &#8220;If they were that smart they&#8217;d already be programming in Lisp.&#8221;</p>

<p>[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing equivalent, but that&#8217;s not the sense of the word programmers care about. (No one wants to program a Turing machine.) The kind of power programmers care about may not be formally definable, but one way to explain it would be to say that it refers to features you could only get in the less powerful language by writing an interpreter for the more powerful language in it. If language A has an operator for removing spaces from strings and language B doesn&#8217;t, that probably doesn&#8217;t make A more powerful, because you can probably write a subroutine to do it in B. But if A supports, say, recursion, and B doesn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s not likely to be something you can fix by writing library functions.</p>

<p>[4] Note to nerds: or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top; it&#8217;s not the shape that matters here but the idea that there is at least a partial order.</p>

<p>[5] It is a bit misleading to treat macros as a separate feature. In practice their usefulness is greatly enhanced by other Lisp features like lexical closures and rest parameters.</p>

<p>[6] As a result, comparisons of programming languages either take the form of religious wars or undergraduate textbooks so determinedly neutral that they&#8217;re really works of anthropology. People who value their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic. But the question is only half a religious one; there is something there worth studying, especially if you want to design new languages.</p>

<p>(原文写于2004年5月)</p>

<p>（本文最初发表在《黑客与画家》一书中）。</p>

<p>如果你想致富，你会怎么做呢？我认为，你最好把赌注压在一个创业公司上，你可以加入或创建一家创业公司。几百年来，创业都是致富的好方法。尽管 “创业”这个字眼是在20世纪60年代才出现的，但创业行为却像中世纪受资出海的贸易行为一样古老。</p>

<p>初创企业通常都要涉及技术，以至于“高科技创业公司”这个词显得相当啰嗦。创业公司虽然小，却能够解决过硬的技术问题。</p>

<p>不少人空有追逐财富的野心，却缺乏相关知识。假如你要做个优秀的投手，你不必懂物理学。但我认为，物理学可以给你展现基本原则的一个侧面。创业公司为什么非小不可？当创业公司日益茁壮之后，它是否不可避免地丧失了创业公司的特性？为什么创业公司经常开发新技术？为什么有有这么多创业公司纷纷销售新药物、新的计算机软件，却没有人去卖玉米油与洗衣粉呢？</p>

<p>财富问题</p>

<p>以经济学的视角而言，你不妨将创业公司想象为将您的整个工作生涯压缩到短短几年的一种方法。抛弃以低强度工作四十年的方法，你卯尽全力工作。尤其是在技术领域里，你能从自己迅速的执行中获得丰厚溢价。</p>

<p>让我们为这个经济问题做一番简单计算。假设你是一位二十几岁的黑客，你可以找到一份年薪80,000美元左右的工作。因此，平均一位黑客必须能够为公司每年至少创造80,000美元的价值，这还仅仅是收支平衡的状况。作为一名企业员工，你的效率或许是他人的两倍，假使你非常专注，你一个小时能完成别人3个小时才能做完的事。 [1]由于你有效地消除了不好说话的中层经理带来的阻力，你还有可能将自己的效率再翻上两倍。再有一个得分点：你究竟比你的职位描述聪明多少倍呢？我们假设有三倍好了。综合这些因素，我宣布，比起在某家公司工作而言，你能创造出36倍之多生产力价值。 [2]假如一位优秀的黑客就职于一家大公司，每年获得80,000元作为回报，那么，一位摆脱大公司繁冗缛节的精明黑客，勤奋工作，他一年应该能够创造出大约300万美元的价值。</p>

<p>我这里不过是举了个例子，这其间的数字值得商榷。我并不打算确证这些数字。然而，我支持这种计算方式。我觉得倍数不见得有36倍之多，但我认为，肯定远远超过10，不太可能超过100。</p>

<p>假如300万美元的年薪看起来过高了，请记住，我们设定的是一个极端情况：在上面的例子里，你非但一点闲暇时间都没有，你还像个铁人一般，不断辛勤工作，直到你的健康严重透支为止。</p>

<p>创业不是魔术，无法改变创造财富的法则。创业只是代表曲线的尽头一个点。工作中存在守恒定律：如果你想赚一百万美元，你不得不忍受价值一百万美元的痛苦。比如说，赚到一百万美元的方式之一，是用你的全部生命为邮政局工作，节省你的每一分薪水。请想象一下在邮政局工作五十年的压力。你可以开始创业，并将这股压力压缩成三或四年。假如你大批量地购买痛苦，你往往会得到一定的折扣。但你不能回避的基本守恒定律。如果创业有那么容易的话，每个人都会创业去了。</p>

<p>从小处着手</p>

<p>如果在一些人眼中，三百万美元年薪太夸张了，对另一些人来说，三百万却少得可怜。只有三百万？我怎么才能比尔·盖茨那样的亿万富翁呢？</p>

<p>因此，让我们现在就把比尔·盖茨排除在讨论之外。使用名人的发家史当例子，这可不是一个好主意。因为记者通常只报道世界首富，其他富人都被关在媒体门外。比尔·盖茨是一个聪明，坚定，勤奋的人，但想要赚到他这么多钱，你还需要格外走运才行。</p>

<p>任何一家公司的成功，随机因素都占了很大比例。因此，能让你在报纸上读到的那些成功人士，他们不仅很聪明，全心奉献，更是赢得了命运的青睐。当然，比尔·盖茨聪明也敬业，但微软碰巧同时也是商业历史上最壮观失误的受益人之一：DOS许可协议。毫无疑问，比尔·盖茨用尽全力促使IBM犯下这个失误，同时，他也完美地利用了IBM的失误。然而，如果IBM稍有头脑的话，微软的结局就很难说了。那时，微软比IBM的影响小的多。他们不过是个零部件供应商。如果IBM申请了独家授权，并且他们理应如此，微软仍然会签署协议。那份合约对微软来说意味着一大笔钱，而IBM可以轻松地将操作系统应用在其他地方。</p>

<p>相反，IBM结束了市场推广，并让微软制定PC标准。对此，微软只能以执行回应。他们从未大胆决策，去赌上公司的未来。他们想做的，是紧紧地握好许可证这张牌，同时迅速、及时地复制更多的创新产品。</p>

<p>如果IBM没有犯下这个错误，微软将仍然是一个成功的公司，但它不可能迅速地成长为一代霸主。比尔·盖茨也还是个有钱人，但他将会与他的同龄人一起，排在“福布斯”400名附近的位置。</p>

<p>致富的方法千千万，我只写了一条。本文讨论如何通过创造财富赢得金钱，并确实将回报收到手中。还有不少其他方式也能赚到钱，比如：机会、投机、婚姻、继承遗产、盗窃、敲诈、欺诈、垄断、贪污、游说、造假与开矿。大部分大笔财富都有可能来源于上述领域。</p>

<p>创业致富的优势不仅在于它合法（不少其他方法已经被判为非法），更在于它更简单。你不得不做出点人们需要的东西。</p>

<p>金钱不是财富</p>

<p>如果你想创造财富，下文会告诉你什么是财富。财富和金钱不同。 [3]</p>

<p>财富与人类历史一样古老；甚或更古老：蚂蚁也有财富。相对而言，金钱是不久才发明的新玩意。</p>

<p>财富相当根本。财富是我们需要的东西：食物，衣服，房屋，汽车，小工具，前往有趣的地方旅行，等等。你不需要有钱才能获得财富。如果你有一个神奇的万能机器，你一声令下，它就会变成汽车、帮你煮晚餐、洗衣服，完成任何你想让它做的事儿，那你压根就不需要钱。又假如你住在南极洲的中央，那里没什么可买的，你有多少钱也就不再重要了。</p>

<p>财富是你想拥有的东西，而不是钱。但是，假如财富才是根本，那为什么大家都在讨论赚钱呢？这是一种速记法：货币是财富流动的一种方式，并在实践中，钱与财富通常可以互换。但它们并不相同，除非你想获得通过制造伪币致富。过度关注赚钱会让一个人难以理解赚钱的方式。</p>

<p>钱是专业化带来的副作用。在一个高度分工的社会，你无法自己制造大部分你所需要的东西。比如，你想要一只土豆、一根铅笔、一处住地，你必须与他人交换。</p>

<p>你如何能让种植土豆的人给你一些？你要给予对方他想要的回报。但你也不能总靠直接制造别人需要的东西进行交换。如果你会做小提琴，可是当地农民没人想要小提琴，到时你将以何为食呢？</p>

<p>日益专业化的社会发现了解决方案，将交易分为两个步骤。你先用小提琴交换到白银，然后你再用白银去交易你所需之物，而不是直接拿小提琴去换土豆。这中间的交换媒介本可以是任意罕见、便携的物品。历史上，金属一直是最常见的货币，但最近我们一直在使用的交换媒介是实际并不存在的美元。因为它的稀有性由美国政府担保。</p>

<p>交换媒介的优势是，它加速了贸易进行。缺点是，它往往掩盖贸易的真正含义。人们认为，一个企业的目的是赚钱。但钱只是中间阶段 ——一种速记法——用于去交换人们所需之物。大多数企业确实在创造财富。他们制造出人们想要的东西。 [4]</p>

<p>蛋糕的谬论</p>

<p>数量惊人的人仍然保留着童年的天真想法，世界上存在着亘古不变的财富总数。也就是说，每个普通家庭，在任何时刻所拥有的金钱数额总是固定的。但是，这其实是两码事。</p>

<p>宏观经济学里的财富，通常被描述为一个蛋糕。 “你没法做出更大的蛋糕，”政治家说。就你的家庭银行帐户上的资金而言，又或你向政府提供的年税收额来看，这确实是事实。如果一个人得到的多，那别人就得到的就少了。</p>

<p>我记得，当我还是个孩子，我相信少数富人坐拥大部分财富，只留给其余的人一点点。许多人成人之后，似乎仍然继续相信这一点。当你听到有人谈论x％的人口拥有y%的财富时，这一谬论正在背后发挥作用。如果你计划开始创业，那么，不管你是否意识到，你都在试图反驳蛋糕的谬论。</p>

<p>什么使得人们错误地相信金钱的谬论？金钱绝非财富。金钱只是我们用来使财富移动的道具。因此，尽管有时（如您的家人，这个月）能拿来与他人交换货币数额或许是个定值，但是并不存在固定数额的财富这档子事儿。你能够创造更多的财富。人类历史一直源源不断地创造财富、销毁财富（整体看来，创造更多些）。</p>

<p>假设你拥有一辆旧车。你可以花时间保养你的车，让它恢复如新，而不是一整个夏天无所事事。当你这么做，你就在创造财富。世界的财富—— 特别是你的财富——增长了。我说这些并不仅仅是隐喻。如果你卖掉你的车，你会得到更多。</p>

<p>借着将旧车翻新，你增加了自己的财富。你也没有让其他人变得贫穷。显然，固定尺寸的蛋糕并不存在。实际上，当你不再相信固定的财富时，你会怀疑为什么还有人这么认为。 [5]</p>

<p>孩子们都知道——尽管他们不知道自己知道——他们可以创造财富。如果你需要给别人礼物，你又没钱，你就自己做。但是，孩子们不擅长制造，结果，他们认为自制的礼物既古怪又低劣，比不上从商店买来的东西 – 这仅仅是世俗偏见的一种体现。确实，我们为父母做的烟灰缸在零售市场上可不多见。</p>

<p>工匠</p>

<p>最有可能创造财富的人是那些善于做事的匠人。他们的手工制品在商店里出售。但随着工业化的兴起，工匠越来越少。留下来的人数较多的工匠群之一，是程序员。</p>

<p>程序员坐在电脑面前，就能创造财富。一款优秀的软件本身即是价值。让我说得明确点儿。经你键入的那些字符是一个完整、完成的产品。如果有人坐下来，写了一个能够使用的浏览器（顺便说一下，这主意不赖），世界上的财富便增加了。[5B]</p>

<p>公司里，大家齐心协力创造财富，制造大众所需的产品。许多员工（比如收发室的收发员或者人事部门的HR）并没有实际制作产品。程序员并非如此。他们确实思考着产品，一次写下一行代码。 所以对程序员而言，他们更容易理解财富是被创造出来的，而并不是被某个假想的爸爸切下来分好的一块蛋糕。 对程序员而言，以下事实也显而易见：创造财富的效率可以发成巨大变化。在Viaweb，一位程序员是个生产力怪物。我记得，我曾目睹他一天内所做的事情，并估计他已经为该公司的市场价值增加了几十万美元。一个伟大的程序员可以在几个星期内创造一百万美元的财富价值。同时，一个平庸的程序员将产生零甚至是负财富（例如，制造bug）。</p>

<p>这就是为什么这么多杰出的程序员都是自由主义者。在我们的世界，你要么下沉，要么奋力游泳，没有任何借口。当那些远离财富创造的人 – 大学生，记者，政治家 – 听见最富有的5％的人拥有总财富的一半，他们常常认为这不公平！一个有经验的程序员会更容易想到，就这么多吗？要知道，前5％的程序员能写完99%的杰出软件。</p>

<p>创造财富无需出售财富。科学家，起码截止我行文之时，都捐出了他们创造的财富。我们知道青霉素，光是这一知识，就使得我们变得富有。因为我们不太可能死于感染。财富是人们的欲求，而生命每个人都想要。黑客经常编写开源软件，任何人都可以免费使用他们的成果。借由使用FreeBSD的操作系统，我多多少少变得富有了。这个系统目前正在我使用的计算机上运行着。雅虎也因此受益，因为所有的服务器上都运行着FreeBSD。</p>

<p>什么是“工作”？
在工业化国家，人们起码在二十岁前都属于某个机构。毕竟这些年来，你习惯地在某一个小团体找寻归属感，这群人每天早上起床，去往某栋大楼，做些他们并不喜欢做的事情。从属于这样一个群体成为你自我认同的一部分：姓名，年龄，角色，机构。如果你要做自我介绍，或者当别人介绍你，大概是这样：约翰·史密斯，10岁，某某小学的学生，或约翰·史密斯，20岁，某某大专的学生。</p>

<p>当约翰·史密斯完成学业，他有望得到一份工作。和找工作似乎意味着加入另一个机构。从表面上看，公司与大学很相似。你选择你想要为之工作的公司，并申请加入他们的行列。如果有人青睐你，你便成为了新组织的一员。你早上起床，进入另一栋大楼，并做通常意义上你不喜欢做的事情。唯一不同的是：生活并不仅仅是享乐，你得到报酬，而不用像你上大学那样，还需要支付学费。尽管如此，相似还是胜过了差异。约翰·史密斯现在是约翰·史密斯，22岁，在某某公司的软件开发人员。</p>

<p>事实上，约翰·史密斯的生活发生了天翻地覆的变化，他还没有完全意识到这一点。从社会的角度而言，公司看起来很像大学，但你越深入到现实，就越能发现其中的不同。假如一家公司想要基业长青，那么它应该做、并且必须做的一件事是赚钱。大多数公司赚钱的方式就是创造财富。公司的高度专业化使得不同公司相似的盈利性不容易辨识，但是，绝非只有制造企业才创造财富。财富组成部分之一是地点。记得那部神奇的万能机器吗？能变成汽车、为你煮晚餐？假如它把你的晚餐丢在中亚的随便什么地方，那它对你也就没那么有用。如果财富是指人们想要什么，那么，能搬运物资的公司也创造着财富。同上，许多其他类型的企业并不生产实体。然而，几乎所有的公司都在创造人们想要的东西。</p>

<p>这就是当你为公司工作时所做的事儿。但这里有另有他意，往往使人忽略了潜在的现实。在公司，你所做的贡献要与他人均摊。你甚至可能不知道你在创造人们想要的东西。你的贡献可能很间接。但该公司作为一个整体，必须给人们提供出他们想要的东西，否则他们就赚不到钱。如果他们付钱给你X美元一年，那么你必须至少贡献出X美元一年的平均价值，不然公司将入不敷出，最终歇业。</p>

<p>不少从大学毕业的人认为，他需要得到一份工作。别人也是如此告诉他们的。那论调仿佛在说成为一个机构的成员是最重要的事。达到这个目标的更直接的事情：你需要开始做人们想要的东西。做到这一点，你不需要加入一个公司。公司不过是一群人在一起工作，创造人们想要的东西。做人们需要的事才最重要，而不是加入某个组织。 [6]</p>

<p>对于大多数人来说，最好的解决办法就是去一些现有的公司上班。但是理解你在做些什么也非常重要。工作意味着，创造他人所需，并与公司里的其他人分享。</p>

<p>卖力工作</p>

<p>平均分配是一个问题。我觉得困扰大公司的最大的问题是，很难给每个人的工作分配出一个确定的难度。对于大多数人而言，他们碌碌无为。在一家大公司里，你卖力工作，获得一大笔预料之中的薪水。没人希望你无能或懒惰，但你也没有预料到，你的整个生命将投入到你的工作里去。事实证明，投入工作的时间与你得到的回报之间确实存在规模经济。在正当的行业里，那些真正献身于工作的人可以产生比平均员工多达10甚至100倍多的财富。举例，一个程序员可以写出一整个新软件，并用该软件创造出新的收入来源，而不是把时间浪费在维护和更新已有软件上。</p>

<p>公司并不会设奖鼓励人们做到这一点。你没法去找你的老板，说，“我想以十倍的努力工作，所以请你付我十倍的薪水吧。官方说法是，你已经卖力工作了。但更严重的问题是，该公司有没有办法衡量你的工作的价值。</p>

<p>推销员是一个例外。可以很容易地测量销售为公司带来的收入，他们通常按销售比例提成。假如一位推销员要更加努力地工作，那么他便可放手去做，他将自动获得更多的报酬。</p>

<p>除了销售以外，大公司还可以聘请一流的人：高层管理职位。出于同样的原因：他们的表现可以测量。高层管理者负责整个公司的业绩。因为一个普通雇员的表现通常无法测量，没人期望他能比老实干活做的更多。而高层管理人员与销售人员一样，要增加实际数字。该公司的首席执行官，在坚实的努力前无法申辩。如果该公司的业绩垮了，那他显然做得很糟。</p>

<p>如果一家公司能够以让员工负责的方法去支付他们的薪水，这家公司将取得巨大的成功。假如员工能得到报酬，他们将更卖力地工作。更重要的是，这样的公司会吸引到努力工作的员工。这可是粉碎竞争对手的有利出击。</p>

<p>不幸的是，公司无法按照推销员的支付方式去付给每个人薪水。推销员独自工作。大多数员工的工作纠缠在一起。假设一家公司为消费者设计小工具。工程师制作出带有各种新功能、质量可靠的小工具，;工业设计师为它设计一个美丽的外表;营销人说服大家去买这个小东西，他们得有。你怎么知道销售人员从每个小组的努力中获得了多少利益？或者，就这个例子而言，有多少功劳要归于该公司之前产品的创造者，这些人为公司赢得了良好声誉？没有办法算清所有的贡献。即使你会读心术，看穿消费者的心思，你也会发现这些因素纠缠在一起，难舍难分。</p>

<p>如果你想走得更快，将你的工作贡献与其他人的纠结在一起是一个问题。在大的集团中，你的表现无法单独衡量 – 其余部分只会拖慢你的速度。
可评估性与杠杆效应</p>

<p>要致富，你必须为自己在机构中寻得两样道具：可评估性与杠杆。你需要留在一个能够评估你的表现的岗位上。要不然，你做更多事也不会得到报酬。同时，你必须取得杠杆效应，也就是说，在某种意义上，你的决定能够带来很大影响。</p>

<p>仅有可评估性是不够的。仅有可评估性而不存在杠杆效应的一个例子是在血汗工厂做计件工作。尽管衡量你的表现是你将获得相应的报酬，但你没有决定权。你唯一的决定权是，以什么样的速度工作。因此，大概只有两个或三个因素能增加你的收入。</p>

<p>一个既有评估标准又有杠杆效应的工作是电影里的男主角。电影的票房总可以衡量你的表现。你的表现将带来杠杆效应。CEO们也都拥有评估标准与杠杆效应。他们在公司的表现就是评估他们的方法。而他们的决策左右了整个公司的走向，这也是杠杆效应。</p>

<p>我认为每个通过个人努力致富的人，都拥有评估标准与杠杆效应。我能想到的人确实如此：CEO，影视明星，对冲基金经理，专业运动员。杠杆的存在，是对失败可能性的暗示。有得必有失，因此，如果某处存在获利的巨大可能，损失的可能性也越大。CEO、明星、基金经理与运动员每个人的头上都悬着一把剑，当他们开始停滞，他们就出局了。如果你想在工作中获得安全感，你就发不了财。因为假若不存在危险，几乎可以肯定这儿没有杠杆效应。</p>

<p>但你不必成为一个CEO或电影明星才能从评估标准与杠杆中获利。你需要做的不过是成为解决困难的问题的小团体中的一份子。</p>

<p>小巧=可评估性
如果你无法评估员工个人所创造的工作价值，你可以再缩小点范围。你能够评估一个小团体所创造出的工作价值。你可以从整个公司的水平上精确地评估员工所产生的价值。当一个公司很小的时候，你就很容易衡量每一位员工的贡献。一个可行创业公司或许只有10名员工，这便要求你以”十“来衡量个人努力。</p>

<p>开始或加入一个创业公司，很接近大多数人所说的”当老板”。我想十倍努力的工作，因此，请付我十倍之多。这儿有两点不同：你不会直接对你的老板说这么多，而是直接对客户说（你的老板对他们来说，只是代理人罢了）；第二，你无法单独将其完成，你需要与其他小组有野心的人一起。一般情况下，你需要一个团队。除去某些个别工作，比如演戏与写作，一个人是开不了公司的。同时，与你工作的人也得不差，因为你将与他们分享你的工作成果。</p>

<p>一家大公司像一艘千人划桨的巨船。影响巨船速度的有两件事：一，赛艇运动员看不到更加努力工作的结果。二，在一千人中，划船得到的回报很可能会被均摊掉。</p>

<p>如果你随机从巨船上抽出十个人，并让他们自己开船，他们也许可以走得更快。他们身后有胡萝卜加大棒。一个充满活力的运动员将从他创造的实际效果中得到激励。如果有人偷懒，别人很容易发现，并开始抱怨。十人船的真正优势是，当你把十个最好的赛艇运动员挑出来，并把他们放在一条船上，他们将从小团体中获得更多的动力。更重要的是，通过选择，一个小团队有机会成为最好的赛艇。每个人都是顶端的1％。对他们来说，与他们的同等水平的小团体共享财富，而不是与每个人均分，这笔交易很划算。</p>

<p>这是真正的创业公司。理想的情况下，与你走到一起的其他人也卖力工作，并比他们在一家大公司付出得更多。因为初创企业往往是由一小组自我选择、雄心勃勃的人所创建的，他们早已认识彼此（起码听闻过大名），测量的水平比你从渺小仅得到更精确。创业不仅是10人开公司，而是与十个像你这样优秀的人开公司。</p>

<p>史蒂夫·乔布斯曾经说过，创业的成败取决于前十名员工。我同意。它更像是第一个五年。小，本身并不是创业的成功要点，关键是选对了小团体。你不会想成为小村的一员，但想要成为全明星队的一员。</p>

<p>团队越大，其成员的紧密性就将被整体人口平均掉。因此，所有其他的事情都是平等的。在一家大公司非常能干的人可能得不到应有的回报，因为他的表现被其他整体较低的人群所拖累。当然，所有其他的东西往往仍旧不相等：能干的人可能不在乎钱，或者可能更喜欢置身大公司的稳定性。但是，一个非常能干的人，又在乎钱，通常他能做的更好，同时离开这里，并与能与其能力匹敌的人工作。</p>

<p>科技=杠杆</p>

<p>初创企业提供给每一个人评估手段与杠杆效应。他们可估算，因为他们不大，他们能提供杠杆效应，因为他们通过发明新科技赚钱。</p>

<p>什么是科技？科技就是技术。这是我们做事的方式。当你发现一种新的方式来做事，它的价值要与所有使用它的人数相乘。这是众所周知的鱼竿，而不是鱼。这也与开办一间餐厅或理发店不同。你一次煎一只鸡蛋，为一位顾客理发。而如果你解决一个很多人关心的技术问题，又帮助每个人使用您的解决方案。这就带来了杠杆效应。</p>

<p>如果回顾历史，大多数的人都是通过开发新技术而致富的。你不能炒鸡蛋或给别人理发，赚钱速度不够快。是什么让佛罗伦萨于公元1200年致富？是发现了新技术——精细织造布。是什么使荷兰在公元1600年变得富裕？是造船与航海技术，让他们能够称霸远东海域。</p>

<p>幸运的是，精巧与解决困难的问题是天作之合。领先的技术优势行动迅速。今天宝贵的技术可能在几年内就一文不名了。小公司在这个世界更如鱼得水，因为他们官僚层来拖住他们的脚步。此外，技术进步往往来自非正统的方法，小企业较少受公约约束。</p>

<p>大企业可以开发技术。但他们不够快。它们的庞大使他们行动迟缓，以至于他们阻止了他们奖励员工做出杰出贡献。所以大公司只有在需要大量资本的情况下才派得上用场，拥有竞争门槛的技术领域，如微处理器，发电厂，或客机。甚至在这些领域，他们还是依赖于创业公司提供的组件与创意。</p>

<p>很明显，生物技术或软件创业公司的存在是为了努力解决技术问题。但我在那些似乎与技术无关的企业也发现了这一点。例如，麦当劳设计出了一个系统，麦当劳的特许经营权，并将门店布满地球的每一个角落，静候生意发展。麦当劳的特许经营的设计是如此精确，它实际是一个软件控制规则。编写一次，到处运行。同上，沃尔玛也做到了这一点。山姆·沃尔顿并不是通过成为零售商致富的，他是通过设计一种新的商店致富的。
将困难当向导，不只是在选择公司的总体目标，而且也是决策的重点。在Viaweb，我们每一个规则都是向上攀登。假设你个头不大，很灵活，正被一个彪悍的胖家伙追赶。你打开一扇门，发现自己面对着台阶间。你是跑上去还是向下去？要我说，上。假如跑下楼的话，大胖墩和你一样轻而易举。如果要跑上楼，他的大块头将成为他的缺点。向上爬对你来说确实很难，但对他来说，更难。</p>

<p>在实践中，我们特意寻找难题。如果我们能为我们的软件增加两个特性，这两个特性从价值上、难度上都相同，我们总是选更难的那一个。不是仅仅因为它是更有价值，而是因为它更难。我们很高兴在难度上甩开较大、速度较慢的竞争对手。创业就像游击队，喜欢山地势险要，在那些领域，中央政府的正规军可跟不上。我还记得，当我们每天都与一些可怕的技术问题脚力，用尽全力的时候，我非常高兴。因为这些对我们来说艰难的事情，对我们的竞争对手来说，几乎是不可能的。</p>

<p>这不仅仅是一个创业的好方式。这更是创业公司的本质。风险资本家理解这一点，并给它用短语命名：进入壁垒。如果你带着你的新想法，去找一个风险投资人，问他要投资，他会问的第一件事情或许是：要别人来开发需要多长时间？也就是说，在你和潜在的追兵之间，你已经克服了多少困难？ [7]你最好能对你的技术为什么很难复制给出一个令人信服的解释。否则，在大公司意识到这一点后，他们会做出自己的产品，并以自己的品牌、资本和影响力，一夜之间带走你的市场。你会像那些在宽广领域被正规军部队包围的游击队。</p>

<p>进入壁垒的方法之一是专利。但是，专利可能无法提供更多的保护。竞争对手通常能找到办法来解决专利。而且，如果他们不能，他们可能根本就违反法律，然后邀请您来起诉他们。一家大公司从不害怕起诉；对他们来说，这是日常之事。他们将确保，起诉他们很昂贵，费力持久。菲洛·泰勒·法恩斯沃你听过吗？他发明了电视。你从来没有听说过他的理由是，他的公司没从中赚到钱。 [8]赚到钱的公司是RCA，法恩斯沃努力的回报是长达10年的专利诉讼。</p>

<p>在这里，通常来说，最好的防御就是挑战。如果你能开发出很难以为竞争对手复制的技术，你就不需要依靠其他手段防御。开始解决一个困难问题，然后在每一个决策点，都采取更难的选择。 [9]</p>

<p>为难之处</p>

<p>如果一切不过是比普通员工更加努力工作，并得到适当报酬的问题，那么自行创业实在再好不过。当你攀登到某处，你将获得更多乐趣。我并不认为人们喜欢步伐缓慢的大公司、无休止的会议、无趣的谈话、无能的中层管理人员、等等。</p>

<p>不幸的是，鱼和熊掌不能兼得。其一，你不能选择你的出生地点。你也不能决定，你只是想在工作中偶尔努力那么两三回，就获得更多的报酬。当你启动创业公司时，你的竞争对手决定了你的工作有多困难。他们几乎都作出了相同的决定：尽可能的努力。</p>

<p>其他美中不足的是，你不能选择的还有你的平均收益。如我以前说过，任何一个公司的成功是一个大型随机乘数。因此，在实践中，并不是你达到你的工作效率的30倍，就能为你的生产力获得30倍之多的报酬。实情是，你创造出30倍的生产力，得到的回报将在0到1000倍之间。如果平均是30倍，中位数可能是零。大多数成功的创业公司，并不仅仅我们在互联网泡沫期间能在门户网站上看到的。想要开发出真正的好产品，却采取太长的开发周期，结果，钱用完了，不得不关闭，这种情况在创业公司中很常见。</p>

<p>创业就像是一只蚊子。熊能承受重击，螃蟹也有甲壳保护自己，但蚊子只做一件事：进球。不浪费能量防守。作为一个物种，蚊子的防御力便是其种族的繁多，但这对个别蚊子不过是一点安慰罢了。</p>

<p>创业，和蚊子一样，往往是一个全或无的命题。你一般不知道你会得到什么，直到最后一分钟为止。 有几次，viaweb很接近成功。我们的轨迹像一个正弦波。幸运的是我们买在周期的顶部，但它很快停止了。当我们去加利福尼亚州访问雅虎，商谈将公司卖给他们的事宜，我们不得不借用一间会议室，以安抚投资者，他们将为我们提供新一轮的支持我们生存的资金。</p>

<p>初创企业的”要么成功，要么滚蛋“这不是我们想要的东西。 viaweb的黑客都极其厌恶风险。如果曾有有一个方法，能让人努力工作，又得到回报，哈不需要冒风险，我们会非常高兴。我们会更喜欢以100%的几率得到100万美元，而不是以20%的机会得到10亿美元，即使从理论上说，第二个目标的回报是第一个的两倍之多。不幸的是，目前在商业世界的空间里，你没有机会能得到这样的第一笔交易。</p>

<p>你可以得到最接近的是在早期阶段销售创业公司，放弃在规模上的攀升（与风险），但保证收益。我们有机会做到这一点，因为我们当时愚蠢地认为，让还是算了吧。之后，我们滑稽地急于出售。在未来一年左右，如果有人表示对Viaweb存在丝毫的好奇，我们都会尽量向他们出售我们的公司。但没人买帐，所以我们不得不继续下去。</p>

<p>这本来是在早期阶段，我们的价格很低，但做收购的公司没人在寻找便宜货。能收购初创公司的大公司一般都大到了相当保守的地步，公司内负责收购的人也很保守，因为他们很可能是后期加入公司、从商业学校出来的类型。他们宁愿多付点钱，只要更安全。因此很容易卖一个成熟的创业公司，即使价格比较高也比早期的公司好卖。</p>

<p>抓住用户</p>

<p>我认为被收购是一个好主意，如果你能被收购的话。运营企业与发展企业不同。一旦你达到巡航高度，让一家大公司接手比较好。这从财政上看也更明智。因为销售允许你多样化。当一个财务顾问把他​客户的所有资产变成不稳定的股票，你会怎样想？</p>

<p>你如何得到收购？这和如果你不打算出售公司一样，做同样的事情。例如，盈利。但是被收购也是一门艺术，我们花了很多时间将其试图掌握。
潜在买家会一直拖延。被收购的难点是逼迫他们采取行动。对于大多数人来说，最强大的动力不是获得希望的增益，而是避免损失的恐惧。对于潜在的收购者，最强大的动力是他们的竞争对手之一会买你的前景。这一点，我们发现，导致老总采取红眼。第二个担心是，如果他们现在不买你的公司，你将继续快速增长，之后他们将花费更多钱收购你，甚至你还会成为竞争对手。</p>

<p>在上述两种情况下，一切都归结到用户身上。你认为公司收购你的时候，会去做大量的研究，并自行决定你的技术是多么宝贵？不尽然。他们通过你的用户了解你。实际上，收购方假设客户知道谁拥有最好的技术。这一招要比它听起来的高明的多。用户是你在创造财富的唯一真正的证明。财富是人们想要什么，如果人们不使用你的软件，这也许并不仅仅因为你没做营销。也许是因为你做的东西他们不想要。</p>

<p>风险资本家将危险的迹象做成列表一一查看。在列表顶部，是由那些由极客们解决有趣的技术问题，而不是让用户满意的技术怪人运行的公司。在创业之前，你不仅试图解决问题。你更要试图解决用户关心的问题。</p>

<p>所以，我觉得你应该让用户测试，就像收购者做的那样。将创业公司视为通过用户的数量来衡量的一个创化解决方案。任何试图优化软件的人都知道，关键是评估。当您尝试猜测让你的程序慢下来的原因，并想要使其更快，你几乎总是猜错了。用户数量可能不会是个完美的测试结果，但它会很接近。这就是收购者所关心的。这也是收益的来源。这是惹毛竞争对手的原因。这是让记者和潜在的新用户印象深刻的原因。当然，它比你要优先解决哪些问题更重要，不管你是如何在技术上善于测试。说说其他的事情。</p>

<p>把一个创业公司视为最佳优化方案，将有助于你避免另一个风险投资者担心的事实—— 花费很长时间来开发产品。现在，我们可以承认一些黑客已经知道怎么避免过早的优化。尽快做出版本1.0。直到你有一些用户来衡量，你才能在猜测的基础上开始优化。</p>

<p>在这里，你需要保持你所关心的财富遵循了人们想要什么的基本原则。如果你打算通过创业创造财富，你就要知道人们想要什么。因此，少数企业真正重视如何使客户满意。你经常走进一家商店，或打通一家公司的电话号码，却有恐惧的感觉萦绕心头？当你听到“您的来电对我们很重要，请别挂机，”你觉得，哦，好，一切都会顺利吗？</p>

<p>一个餐厅可以承担起某一顿饭烧糊了。但在技术上，一旦你搞砸了一件事，大家就都没得吃。因此，人们想要什么与你提供的之间的矛盾也是成倍增长的。你取悦或烦扰所有客户。你越接近他们想要的东西，你所创造的财富就越多。</p>

<p>财富与权力</p>

<p>财富并不是让你致富的唯一途径。从人类历史上看，这并不是最常见的方式。直到几个世纪以前，财富的主要来源都是矿山、农奴与奴隶、土地、牛；获得财富的唯一途径是通过继承、结姻、征服、或没收。自然财富的声誉不大好。</p>

<p>两件事情改变上述情况。首先是法治。对于大多数世界的历史，如果你没有积累起财富，统治者或他的追随者将找到一种方法偷掉你的钱。但在中世纪的欧洲发生了一些新的情况。新的阶层：商人与工厂主开始在城镇集合。 [10]他们有能力成为当地封建领主。因此，在我们历史上第一回，恶霸停止了偷书呆子的午餐钱。自然，这是一个很大的激励，可能确实是第二大的变化——工业化的主要原因。</p>

<p>工业革命的原因之一是一笔交易，这笔交易的一个必要但不充分的条件是：取得财富的人能够享受和平享受他们的财富。[11]其中一个反例是，那些试图像苏联一样返回到旧模式的国家，比如在20世纪60年代和70年代初的英国工党政府，没有财富的激励，技术创新嘎然而止。</p>

<p>请记住什么是创业的经济学说法：我想工作得更快。而不是慢慢积累，得到五十年的固定工资的回报，我要让回报尽快到来。因此，政府不许你积累财富，实际上，政府是在下令你慢慢工作。他们愿意让你赚了五十多年的3万美元，但他们不愿意让你这么努力，一下子赚到这么多钱。他们就像企业的老板，你不能去告诉老板，我想十倍努力的工作，所以请付我十倍的薪水。除非你可以逃走，开创你自己的公司。</p>

<p>缓慢工作的问题是，它不但使得技术革新变慢，它还扼杀革新。只有当你刻意寻找困难的问题（也也是将好刀用在刀刃上的最佳方式），那你就解决了此项问题。开发新技术很痛苦。就像爱迪生说：百分之一的灵感加上百分之九十九的汗水。没有财富的诱惑，没有人愿意这样做。工程师愿意从事如战斗机和登月火箭那样性感的项目，即使薪金很普通，但必须为企业家发展更加世俗技术，比如灯泡或半导体技术。</p>

<p>创业不只是发生在过去的几十年在硅谷发展。因为它成为可能通过创造财富变得富有，那么，完成的每个人都已经基本上使用相同的配方：可评估性与杠杆效应。评估是量化一个小组的工作，而开发新技术带来杠杆效应。配方都是一样的，和1200年的弗洛洛萨与圣克拉拉没什么两样。</p>

<p>了解这可能有助于回答一个重要的问题：为什么欧洲变得如此强大。是欧洲地理决定的吗？是欧洲人在某种程度上优于其他宗族吗？是他们的宗教吗？答案或许是（至少是最可能的答案）欧洲人借住一个强大理念的力量：让那些创造了财富的人保有财富。</p>

<p>一旦你允许这样做，想发财的人就可以创造财富而不是偷来获得财富。随着而来的科技发展不仅创造了财富，也增进了军事力量的发展。发明隐形飞机的理念是由苏联的数学家创造的。但因为苏联没有计算机行业，其理念仍然停留在纸面上。他们没有能够执行的计算能力去完成飞机实际设计的硬件。
在这方面，冷战与二战都给了我们不少教训。因为财富，人们发动了近代历史上的大多数战争。不要让战士与政治家挤碎企业家。相同的配方，使个人富裕，使国家强大。让书呆子看好他们的午餐钱，而你统治世界。</p>

<p>注释：
[1]有样东西很有价值，只有在创业公司才能得到，就是不间断性。不同种类的工作有不同的时间份额。校对手稿的人很可能每十五分钟就被中断一次，每一次损失一点儿生产力。但黑客的时间量子是很长，一个小时只不过是将一个问题加载到脑中罢了。</p>

<p>因此，一个人力资源的人告诉你你忘记填写了一张表格，那么这样的损失将会是巨大的。这就是为什么黑客从屏幕前转过头来回答你的问题时，他们狠狠地盯了你一眼。叠在他们头上的扑克牌搭建的房子正摇摇欲坠呢。</p>

<p>仅仅是被打扰的可能性就让黑客无法专注在难题上。这就是为什么他们往往工作到深夜，也是为什么在一个隔间里不可能写出伟大的软件（深夜除外）。</p>

<p>初创公司的一个巨大优势是，他们还没有任何人能来打断你。</p>

<p>没有人事部门，因此，不需要任何形式，也没有任何人打电话给你。</p>

<p>[2]面对这样一个主意，为初创企业工作的人可能会产出20或30倍于为大公司工作的生产力。大公司的高管，自然会觉得奇怪，我怎么能为我工作的人做这件事呢？答案很简单：支付他们。</p>

<p>国内大多数企业都像共产主义国家。如果你相信在自由市场，为什么不把你的公司变成自由市场？假设：当A公司的每个员工以他们所产生的最大财富比例支付时，该公司将获得最大的利益。</p>

<p>[3]直到最近，甚至政府都没有掌握金钱与财富之间的区别。亚当·斯密（国富论，V：I）中提到了几个试图通过禁止出口的黄金或白银保留他们的财富。但是拥有更多的交换媒介不会使一个国家变得富裕，如果你有更多的钱追逐同样数量的物质财富，唯一的结果就是价格变高了。</p>

<p>[4]围绕着“财富”有许多意义，并非所有意义都指出财富是物质。我并不想在这里作出深刻的哲学阐释，分清哪些是真哪些是假。我正在写关于一个特定的而不是技术意义上的“财富”：那些能让别人为你付钱的东西。这是一个有趣的财富分类研究，因为它能让你免于忍饥挨饿。什么人给你钱取决于他们，而不是你。</p>

<p>当你刚开始创业，很容易滑入以为客户需要你做些什么。在互联网泡沫期间，我跟一位喜欢户外活动的女性聊天，她开设了“户外门户。”你知道，如果你喜欢户外活动，你应该开创什么样的企业呢？其中一项是从坠毁的硬盘中恢复数据。</p>

<p>这中间有什么相同点？压根没有。而这恰恰是我的观点。如果你想创造财富（狭窄地说，就是不被饿死），那么你就应该对任何计划都保持怀疑态度，也包括你喜欢做的事情。从而你可以懂得，什么是有价值的，至少是最有可能配合其他人的。</p>

<p>[5]平均看来，在车的修复中，你可能在微观上为别人带来损害，因为给环境带来了微量损害。环境成本应该被考虑进去，他们不会导致财富的零和游戏。例如，如果你修复一个破碎机，因为部分已经拧开，假如你没有增加环境成本，那么你就增加了财富成本。</p>

<p>[5B]写这篇文章之时，火狐还没有出现。</p>

<p>[6]许多人在二十多岁的时候感到困惑和沮丧。在大学生活乐趣多多。嗯，当然是。不要被表面现象所愚弄了。你已经从客人变成了仆人。在新的世界可能挺有乐趣的。不管其他，你现在可以躲在门后，门上写着，“非请勿入。”但是，这些变化一开始挺令人惊讶的，最糟糕的是，假如你没有意识到这一点。</p>

<p>[7]当VC要求我们回答，另一家创业公司复制我们的软件需要多久的时候，我们说：他们压根复制不了。我觉得，这使我们看起来要么很幼稚，要么很忽悠。</p>

<p>[8]一些技术有一位明确的发明者。因此，作为一项规则，如果你知道某样发明的“发明者”（电话，装配生产线，飞机，电灯泡，晶体管），是因为他们的公司赚到了钱，还有该公司的公关人工作努力，传播这些故事。如果你不知道是谁发明的东西（汽车，电视，电脑，喷气发动机，激光），这是因为其他公司都赚到了钱。</p>

<p>[9]这从来都是生活中下判断一个好方法。如果你有两个选择，选择难的那一个。如果你想决定是否要出去跑步，或者坐在家里看电视；去跑步。这招好使的原因是，当你有两个选择，其中有一个很难，那你还在考的唯一原因是因为你懒惰。你知道什么是正确的事情，这一招只是迫使你承认这一点。</p>

<p>[10]中产阶级第一次出现在意大利北部和其他海拔较低的国家或许并非偶然，因为那里有没有强有力的中央政府。这两个地区在那时最为富有，并成为文艺复兴时期的文明辐射的双中心。如果他们不再扮演这一角色，这是因为其他地方，比如美国，已经更为彻底地贯彻这一法则。</p>

<p>[11]这可能确实是一个充分条件。但即便如此，为什么工业革命没有更早发生？两种可能（并非互斥不）答案：（a）已然发生。工业革命便是其中的一系列。 （b）由于垄断和行规盛行于中世纪的城镇，放慢了新生产手段的发展。</p>

<p>May 2004</p>

<p>(This essay was originally published in Hackers &amp; Painters.)</p>

<p>If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup. That&#8217;s been a reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years. The word &#8220;startup&#8221; dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase &#8220;high-tech startup&#8221; is almost redundant. A startup is a small company that takes on a hard technical problem.</p>

<p>Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that. You don&#8217;t have to know physics to be a good pitcher. But I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles. Why do startups have to be small? Will a startup inevitably stop being a startup as it grows larger? And why do they so often work on developing new technology? Why are there so many startups selling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil or laundry detergent?</p>

<p>The Proposition</p>

<p>Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four. This pays especially well in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.</p>

<p>Here is a brief sketch of the economic proposition. If you&#8217;re a good hacker in your mid twenties, you can get a job paying about $80,000 per year. So on average such a hacker must be able to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the company just to break even. You could probably work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if you focus you can probably get three times as much done in an hour. [1] You should get another multiple of two, at least, by eliminating the drag of the pointy-haired middle manager who would be your boss in a big company. Then there is one more multiple: how much smarter are you than your job description expects you to be? Suppose another multiple of three. Combine all these multipliers, and I&#8217;m claiming you could be 36 times more productive than you&#8217;re expected to be in a random corporate job. [2] If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a big company, then a smart hacker working very hard without any corporate bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about $3 million a year.</p>

<p>Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one has a lot of wiggle room. I wouldn&#8217;t try to defend the actual numbers. But I stand by the structure of the calculation. I&#8217;m not claiming the multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more than 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.</p>

<p>If $3 million a year seems high, remember that we&#8217;re talking about the limit case: the case where you not only have zero leisure time but indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.</p>

<p>Startups are not magic. They don&#8217;t change the laws of wealth creation. They just represent a point at the far end of the curve. There is a conservation law at work here: if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars&#8217; worth of pain. For example, one way to make a million dollars would be to work for the Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your salary. Imagine the stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years. In a startup you compress all this stress into three or four years. You do tend to get a certain bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain, but you can&#8217;t evade the fundamental conservation law. If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.</p>

<p>Millions, not Billions</p>

<p>If $3 million a year seems high to some people, it will seem low to others. Three million? How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s get Bill Gates out of the way right now. It&#8217;s not a good idea to use famous rich people as examples, because the press only write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers. Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man, but you need more than that to make as much money as he has. You also need to be very lucky.</p>

<p>There is a large random factor in the success of any company. So the guys you end up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very smart, totally dedicated, and win the lottery. Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for DOS. No doubt Bill did everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder, and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if there had been one person with a brain on IBM&#8217;s side, Microsoft&#8217;s future would have been very different. Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM. They were effectively a component supplier. If IBM had required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft would still have signed the deal. It would still have meant a lot of money for them, and IBM could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.</p>

<p>Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market to give Microsoft control of the PC standard. From that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute. They never had to bet the company on a bold decision. All they had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more innovative products reasonably promptly.</p>

<p>If IBM hadn&#8217;t made this mistake, Microsoft would still have been a successful company, but it could not have grown so big so fast. Bill Gates would be rich, but he&#8217;d be somewhere near the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.</p>

<p>There are a lot of ways to get rich, and this essay is about only one of them. This essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and getting paid for it. There are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying, counterfeiting, and prospecting. Most of the greatest fortunes have probably involved several of these.</p>

<p>The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich, is not just that it&#8217;s more legitimate (many of the other methods are now illegal) but that it&#8217;s more straightforward. You just have to do something people want.</p>

<p>Money Is Not Wealth</p>

<p>If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is. Wealth is not the same thing as money. [3] Wealth is as old as human history. Far older, in fact; ants have wealth. Money is a comparatively recent invention.</p>

<p>Wealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. If you had a magic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn&#8217;t need money. Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is nothing to buy, it wouldn&#8217;t matter how much money you had.</p>

<p>Wealth is what you want, not money. But if wealth is the important thing, why does everyone talk about making money? It is a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice they are usually interchangeable. But they are not the same thing, and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about making money can make it harder to understand how to make money.</p>

<p>Money is a side effect of specialization. In a specialized society, most of the things you need, you can&#8217;t make for yourself. If you want a potato or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone else.</p>

<p>How do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some? By giving him something he wants in return. But you can&#8217;t get very far by trading things directly with the people who need them. If you make violins, and none of the local farmers wants one, how will you eat?</p>

<p>The solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is to make the trade into a two-step process. Instead of trading violins directly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver, which you can then trade again for anything else you need. The intermediate stuff&#8211; the medium of exchange&#8211; can be anything that&#8217;s rare and portable. Historically metals have been the most common, but recently we&#8217;ve been using a medium of exchange, called the dollar, that doesn&#8217;t physically exist. It works as a medium of exchange, however, because its rarity is guaranteed by the U.S. Government.</p>

<p>The advantage of a medium of exchange is that it makes trade work. The disadvantage is that it tends to obscure what trade really means. People think that what a business does is make money. But money is just the intermediate stage&#8211; just a shorthand&#8211; for whatever people want. What most businesses really do is make wealth. They do something people want. [4]</p>

<p>The Pie Fallacy</p>

<p>A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world. There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of money at any moment. But that&#8217;s not the same thing.</p>

<p>When wealth is talked about in this context, it is often described as a pie. &#8220;You can&#8217;t make the pie larger,&#8221; say politicians. When you&#8217;re talking about the amount of money in one family&#8217;s bank account, or the amount available to a government from one year&#8217;s tax revenue, this is true. If one person gets more, someone else has to get less.</p>

<p>I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else. Many people seem to continue to believe something like this well into adulthood. This fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how x percent of the population have y percent of the wealth. If you plan to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you&#8217;re planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.</p>

<p>What leads people astray here is the abstraction of money. Money is not wealth. It&#8217;s just something we use to move wealth around. So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to trade with other people for things you want, there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world. You can make more wealth. Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.</p>

<p>Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt next summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In doing so you create wealth. The world is&#8211; and you specifically are&#8211; one pristine old car the richer. And not just in some metaphorical way. If you sell your car, you&#8217;ll get more for it.</p>

<p>In restoring your old car you have made yourself richer. You haven&#8217;t made anyone else poorer. So there is obviously not a fixed pie. And in fact, when you look at it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was. [5]</p>

<p>Kids know, without knowing they know, that they can create wealth. If you need to give someone a present and don&#8217;t have any money, you make one. But kids are so bad at making things that they consider home-made presents to be a distinct, inferior, sort of thing to store-bought ones&#8211; a mere expression of the proverbial thought that counts. And indeed, the lumpy ashtrays we made for our parents did not have much of a resale market.</p>

<p>Craftsmen</p>

<p>The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen. Their hand-made objects become store-bought ones. But with the rise of industrialization there are fewer and fewer craftsmen. One of the biggest remaining groups is computer programmers.</p>

<p>A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and create wealth. A good piece of software is, in itself, a valuable thing. There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue. Those characters you type are a complete, finished product. If someone sat down and wrote a web browser that didn&#8217;t suck (a fine idea, by the way), the world would be that much richer. [5b]</p>

<p>Everyone in a company works together to create wealth, in the sense of making more things people want. Many of the employees (e.g. the people in the mailroom or the personnel department) work at one remove from the actual making of stuff. Not the programmers. They literally think the product, one line at a time. And so it&#8217;s clearer to programmers that wealth is something that&#8217;s made, rather than being distributed, like slices of a pie, by some imaginary Daddy.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also obvious to programmers that there are huge variations in the rate at which wealth is created. At Viaweb we had one programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity. I remember watching what he did one long day and estimating that he had added several hundred thousand dollars to the market value of the company. A great programmer, on a roll, could create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks. A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).</p>

<p>This is why so many of the best programmers are libertarians. In our world, you sink or swim, and there are no excuses. When those far removed from the creation of wealth&#8211; undergraduates, reporters, politicians&#8211; hear that the richest 5% of the people have half the total wealth, they tend to think injustice! An experienced programmer would be more likely to think is that all? The top 5% of programmers probably write 99% of the good software.</p>

<p>Wealth can be created without being sold. Scientists, till recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they created. We are all richer for knowing about penicillin, because we&#8217;re less likely to die from infections. Wealth is whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something we want. Hackers often donate their work by writing open source software that anyone can use for free. I am much the richer for the operating system FreeBSD, which I&#8217;m running on the computer I&#8217;m using now, and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.</p>

<p>What a Job Is</p>

<p>In industrialized countries, people belong to one institution or another at least until their twenties. After all those years you get used to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get up in the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing. Belonging to such a group becomes part of your identity: name, age, role, institution. If you have to introduce yourself, or someone else describes you, it will be as something like, John Smith, age 10, a student at such and such elementary school, or John Smith, age 20, a student at such and such college.</p>

<p>When John Smith finishes school he is expected to get a job. And what getting a job seems to mean is joining another institution. Superficially it&#8217;s a lot like college. You pick the companies you want to work for and apply to join them. If one likes you, you become a member of this new group. You get up in the morning and go to a new set of buildings, and do things that you do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing. There are a few differences: life is not as much fun, and you get paid, instead of paying, as you did in college. But the similarities feel greater than the differences. John Smith is now John Smith, 22, a software developer at such and such corporation.</p>

<p>In fact John Smith&#8217;s life has changed more than he realizes. Socially, a company looks much like college, but the deeper you go into the underlying reality, the more different it gets.</p>

<p>What a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue to exist, is earn money. And the way most companies make money is by creating wealth. Companies can be so specialized that this similarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing companies that create wealth. A big component of wealth is location. Remember that magic machine that could make you cars and cook you dinner and so on? It would not be so useful if it delivered your dinner to a random location in central Asia. If wealth means what people want, companies that move things also create wealth. Ditto for many other kinds of companies that don&#8217;t make anything physical. Nearly all companies exist to do something people want.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s what you do, as well, when you go to work for a company. But here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlying reality. In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other people&#8217;s. You may not even be aware you&#8217;re doing something people want. Your contribution may be indirect. But the company as a whole must be giving people something they want, or they won&#8217;t make any money. And if they are paying you x dollars a year, then on average you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth of work, or the company will be spending more than it makes, and will go out of business.</p>

<p>Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs to get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of an institution. A more direct way to put it would be: you need to start doing something people want. You don&#8217;t need to join a company to do that. All a company is is a group of people working together to do something people want. It&#8217;s doing something people want that matters, not joining the group. [6]</p>

<p>For most people the best plan probably is to go to work for some existing company. But it is a good idea to understand what&#8217;s happening when you do this. A job means doing something people want, averaged together with everyone else in that company.</p>

<p>Working Harder</p>

<p>That averaging gets to be a problem. I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the difficulty of assigning a value to each person&#8217;s work. For the most part they punt. In a big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working fairly hard. You&#8217;re expected not to be obviously incompetent or lazy, but you&#8217;re not expected to devote your whole life to your work.</p>

<p>It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your life you devote to your work. In the right kind of business, someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or even a hundred times as much wealth as an average employee. A programmer, for example, instead of chugging along maintaining and updating an existing piece of software, could write a whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source of revenue.</p>

<p>Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this. You can&#8217;t go to your boss and say, I&#8217;d like to start working ten times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? For one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as hard as you can. But a more serious problem is that the company has no way of measuring the value of your work.</p>

<p>Salesmen are an exception. It&#8217;s easy to measure how much revenue they generate, and they&#8217;re usually paid a percentage of it. If a salesman wants to work harder, he can just start doing it, and he will automatically get paid proportionally more.</p>

<p>There is one other job besides sales where big companies can hire first-rate people: in the top management jobs. And for the same reason: their performance can be measured. The top managers are held responsible for the performance of the entire company. Because an ordinary employee&#8217;s performance can&#8217;t usually be measured, he is not expected to do more than put in a solid effort. Whereas top management, like salespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers. The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in a solid effort. If the company does badly, he&#8217;s done badly.</p>

<p>A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly would be enormously successful. Many employees would work harder if they could get paid for it. More importantly, such a company would attract people who wanted to work especially hard. It would crush its competitors.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, companies can&#8217;t pay everyone like salesmen. Salesmen work alone. Most employees&#8217; work is tangled together. Suppose a company makes some kind of consumer gadget. The engineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features; the industrial designers design a beautiful case for it; and then the marketing people convince everyone that it&#8217;s something they&#8217;ve got to have. How do you know how much of the gadget&#8217;s sales are due to each group&#8217;s efforts? Or, for that matter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that gave the company a reputation for quality? There&#8217;s no way to untangle all their contributions. Even if you could read the minds of the consumers, you&#8217;d find these factors were all blurred together.</p>

<p>If you want to go faster, it&#8217;s a problem to have your work tangled together with a large number of other people&#8217;s. In a large group, your performance is not separately measurable&#8211; and the rest of the group slows you down.</p>

<p>Measurement and Leverage</p>

<p>To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.</p>

<p>Measurement alone is not enough. An example of a job with measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a sweatshop. Your performance is measured and you get paid accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions. The only decision you get to make is how fast you work, and that can probably only increase your earnings by a factor of two or three.</p>

<p>An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would be lead actor in a movie. Your performance can be measured in the gross of the movie. And you have leverage in the sense that your performance can make or break it.</p>

<p>CEOs also have both measurement and leverage. They&#8217;re measured, in that the performance of the company is their performance. And they have leverage in that their decisions set the whole company moving in one direction or another.</p>

<p>I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, hedge fund managers, professional athletes. A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure. Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying possibility of loss. CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes all live with the sword hanging over their heads; the moment they start to suck, they&#8217;re out. If you&#8217;re in a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.</p>

<p>But you don&#8217;t have to become a CEO or a movie star to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. All you need to do is be part of a small group working on a hard problem.</p>

<p>Smallness = Measurement</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t measure the value of the work done by individual employees, you can get close. You can measure the value of the work done by small groups.</p>

<p>One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue generated by employees is at the level of the whole company. When the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to measuring the contributions of individual employees. A viable startup might only have ten employees, which puts you within a factor of ten of measuring individual effort.</p>

<p>Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most people can get to saying to one&#8217;s boss, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times as much. There are two differences: you&#8217;re not saying it to your boss, but directly to the customers (for whom your boss is only a proxy after all), and you&#8217;re not doing it individually, but along with a small group of other ambitious people.</p>

<p>It will, ordinarily, be a group. Except in a few unusual kinds of work, like acting or writing books, you can&#8217;t be a company of one person. And the people you work with had better be good, because it&#8217;s their work that yours is going to be averaged with.</p>

<p>A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers. Two things keep the speed of the galley down. One is that individual rowers don&#8217;t see any result from working harder. The other is that, in a group of a thousand people, the average rower is likely to be pretty average.</p>

<p>If you took ten people at random out of the big galley and put them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go faster. They would have both carrot and stick to motivate them. An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thought that he could have a visible effect on the speed of the boat. And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely to notice and complain.</p>

<p>But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when you take the ten best rowers out of the big galley and put them in a boat together. They will have all the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group. But more importantly, by selecting that small a group you can get the best rowers. Each one will be in the top 1%. It&#8217;s a much better deal for them to average their work together with a small group of their peers than to average it with everyone.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the real point of startups. Ideally, you are getting together with a group of other people who also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in a big company. And because startups tend to get founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already know one another (at least by reputation), the level of measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone. A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs once said that the success or failure of a startup depends on the first ten employees. I agree. If anything, it&#8217;s more like the first five. Being small is not, in itself, what makes startups kick butt, but rather that small groups can be select. You don&#8217;t want small in the sense of a village, but small in the sense of an all-star team.</p>

<p>The larger a group, the closer its average member will be to the average for the population as a whole. So all other things being equal, a very able person in a big company is probably getting a bad deal, because his performance is dragged down by the overall lower performance of the others. Of course, all other things often are not equal: the able person may not care about money, or may prefer the stability of a large company. But a very able person who does care about money will ordinarily do better to go off and work with a small group of peers.</p>

<p>Technology = Leverage</p>

<p>Startups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. They allow measurement because they&#8217;re small, and they offer leverage because they make money by inventing new technology.</p>

<p>What is technology? It&#8217;s technique. It&#8217;s the way we all do things. And when you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied by all the people who use it. It is the proverbial fishing rod, rather than the fish. That&#8217;s the difference between a startup and a restaurant or a barber shop. You fry eggs or cut hair one customer at a time. Whereas if you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution. That&#8217;s leverage.</p>

<p>If you look at history, it seems that most people who got rich by creating wealth did it by developing new technology. You just can&#8217;t fry eggs or cut hair fast enough. What made the Florentines rich in 1200 was the discovery of new techniques for making the high-tech product of the time, fine woven cloth. What made the Dutch rich in 1600 was the discovery of shipbuilding and navigation techniques that enabled them to dominate the seas of the Far East.</p>

<p>Fortunately there is a natural fit between smallness and solving hard problems. The leading edge of technology moves fast. Technology that&#8217;s valuable today could be worthless in a couple years. Small companies are more at home in this world, because they don&#8217;t have layers of bureaucracy to slow them down. Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches, and small companies are less constrained by convention.</p>

<p>Big companies can develop technology. They just can&#8217;t do it quickly. Their size makes them slow and prevents them from rewarding employees for the extraordinary effort required. So in practice big companies only get to develop technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups from competing with them, like microprocessors, power plants, or passenger aircraft. And even in those fields they depend heavily on startups for components and ideas.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solve hard technical problems, but I think it will also be found to be true in businesses that don&#8217;t seem to be about technology. McDonald&#8217;s, for example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald&#8217;s franchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the face of the earth. A McDonald&#8217;s franchise is controlled by rules so precise that it is practically a piece of software. Write once, run everywhere. Ditto for Wal-Mart. Sam Walton got rich not by being a retailer, but by designing a new kind of store.</p>

<p>Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way. At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was run upstairs. Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big, fat, bully. You open a door and find yourself in a staircase. Do you go up or down? I say up. The bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can. Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage. Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.</p>

<p>What this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought hard problems. If there were two features we could add to our software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty, we&#8217;d always take the harder one. Not just because it was more valuable, but because it was harder. We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors to follow us over difficult ground. Like guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the mountains, where the troops of the central government can&#8217;t follow. I can remember times when we were just exhausted after wrestling all day with some horrible technical problem. And I&#8217;d be delighted, because something that was hard for us would be impossible for our competitors.</p>

<p>This is not just a good way to run a startup. It&#8217;s what a startup is. Venture capitalists know about this and have a phrase for it: barriers to entry. If you go to a VC with a new idea and ask him to invest in it, one of the first things he&#8217;ll ask is, how hard would this be for someone else to develop? That is, how much difficult ground have you put between yourself and potential pursuers? [7] And you had better have a convincing explanation of why your technology would be hard to duplicate. Otherwise as soon as some big company becomes aware of it, they&#8217;ll make their own, and with their brand name, capital, and distribution clout, they&#8217;ll take away your market overnight. You&#8217;d be like guerillas caught in the open field by regular army forces.</p>

<p>One way to put up barriers to entry is through patents. But patents may not provide much protection. Competitors commonly find ways to work around a patent. And if they can&#8217;t, they may simply violate it and invite you to sue them. A big company is not afraid to be sued; it&#8217;s an everyday thing for them. They&#8217;ll make sure that suing them is expensive and takes a long time. Ever heard of Philo Farnsworth? He invented television. The reason you&#8217;ve never heard of him is that his company was not the one to make money from it. [8] The company that did was RCA, and Farnsworth&#8217;s reward for his efforts was a decade of patent litigation.</p>

<p>Here, as so often, the best defense is a good offense. If you can develop technology that&#8217;s simply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don&#8217;t need to rely on other defenses. Start by picking a hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice. [9]</p>

<p>The Catch(es)</p>

<p>If it were simply a matter of working harder than an ordinary employee and getting paid proportionately, it would obviously be a good deal to start a startup. Up to a point it would be more fun. I don&#8217;t think many people like the slow pace of big companies, the interminable meetings, the water-cooler conversations, the clueless middle managers, and so on.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are a couple catches. One is that you can&#8217;t choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit. You can&#8217;t decide, for example, that you&#8217;d like to work just two or three times as hard, and get paid that much more. When you&#8217;re running a startup, your competitors decide how hard you work. And they pretty much all make the same decision: as hard as you possibly can.</p>

<p>The other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionate to your productivity. There is, as I said before, a large random multiplier in the success of any company. So in practice the deal is not that you&#8217;re 30 times as productive and get paid 30 times as much. It is that you&#8217;re 30 times as productive, and get paid between zero and a thousand times as much. If the mean is 30x, the median is probably zero. Most startups tank, and not just the dogfood portals we all heard about during the Internet Bubble. It&#8217;s common for a startup to be developing a genuinely good product, take slightly too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.</p>

<p>A startup is like a mosquito. A bear can absorb a hit and a crab is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing: to score. No energy is wasted on defense. The defense of mosquitos, as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little consolation to the individual mosquito.</p>

<p>Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition. And you don&#8217;t generally know which of the two you&#8217;re going to get till the last minute. Viaweb came close to tanking several times. Our trajectory was like a sine wave. Fortunately we got bought at the top of the cycle, but it was damned close. While we were visiting Yahoo in California to talk about selling the company to them, we had to borrow a conference room to reassure an investor who was about to back out of a new round of funding that we needed to stay alive.</p>

<p>The all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted. Viaweb&#8217;s hackers were all extremely risk-averse. If there had been some way just to work super hard and get paid for it, without having a lottery mixed in, we would have been delighted. We would have much preferred a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though theoretically the second is worth twice as much. Unfortunately, there is not currently any space in the business world where you can get the first deal.</p>

<p>The closest you can get is by selling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside (and risk) for a smaller but guaranteed payoff. We had a chance to do this, and stupidly, as we then thought, let it slip by. After that we became comically eager to sell. For the next year or so, if anyone expressed the slightest curiousity about Viaweb we would try to sell them the company. But there were no takers, so we had to keep going.</p>

<p>It would have been a bargain to buy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are not looking for bargains. A company big enough to acquire startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and within the company the people in charge of acquisitions will be among the more conservative, because they are likely to be business school types who joined the company late. They would rather overpay for a safe choice. So it is easier to sell an established startup, even at a large premium, than an early-stage one.</p>

<p>Get Users</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s a good idea to get bought, if you can. Running a business is different from growing one. It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach cruising altitude. It&#8217;s also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify. What would you think of a financial advisor who put all his client&#8217;s assets into one volatile stock?</p>

<p>How do you get bought? Mostly by doing the same things you&#8217;d do if you didn&#8217;t intend to sell the company. Being profitable, for example. But getting bought is also an art in its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time trying to master.</p>

<p>Potential buyers will always delay if they can. The hard part about getting bought is getting them to act. For most people, the most powerful motivator is not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss. For potential acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that one of their competitors will buy you. This, as we found, causes CEOs to take red-eyes. The second biggest is the worry that, if they don&#8217;t buy you now, you&#8217;ll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to acquire later, or even become a competitor.</p>

<p>In both cases, what it all comes down to is users. You&#8217;d think that a company about to buy you would do a lot of research and decide for themselves how valuable your technology was. Not at all. What they go by is the number of users you have.</p>

<p>In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the best technology. And this is not as stupid as it sounds. Users are the only real proof that you&#8217;ve created wealth. Wealth is what people want, and if people aren&#8217;t using your software, maybe it&#8217;s not just because you&#8217;re bad at marketing. Maybe it&#8217;s because you haven&#8217;t made what they want.</p>

<p>Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for. Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead of making users happy. In a startup, you&#8217;re not just trying to solve problems. You&#8217;re trying to solve problems that users care about.</p>

<p>So I think you should make users the test, just as acquirers do. Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is measured by number of users. As anyone who has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement. When you try to guess where your program is slow, and what would make it faster, you almost always guess wrong.</p>

<p>Number of users may not be the perfect test, but it will be very close. It&#8217;s what acquirers care about. It&#8217;s what revenues depend on. It&#8217;s what makes competitors unhappy. It&#8217;s what impresses reporters, and potential new users. Certainly it&#8217;s a better test than your a priori notions of what problems are important to solve, no matter how technically adept you are.</p>

<p>Among other things, treating a startup as an optimization problem will help you avoid another pitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly&#8211; taking a long time to develop a product. Now we can recognize this as something hackers already know to avoid: premature optimization. Get a version 1.0 out there as soon as you can. Until you have some users to measure, you&#8217;re optimizing based on guesses.</p>

<p>The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the underlying principle that wealth is what people want. If you plan to get rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want. So few businesses really pay attention to making customers happy. How often do you walk into a store, or call a company on the phone, with a feeling of dread in the back of your mind? When you hear &#8220;your call is important to us, please stay on the line,&#8221; do you think, oh good, now everything will be all right?</p>

<p>A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner. But in technology, you cook one thing and that&#8217;s what everyone eats. So any difference between what people want and what you deliver is multiplied. You please or annoy customers wholesale. The closer you can get to what they want, the more wealth you generate.</p>

<p>Wealth and Power</p>

<p>Making wealth is not the only way to get rich. For most of human history it has not even been the most common. Until a few centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.</p>

<p>Two things changed. The first was the rule of law. For most of the world&#8217;s history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his henchmen would find a way to steal it. But in medieval Europe something new happened. A new class of merchants and manufacturers began to collect in towns. [10] Together they were able to withstand the local feudal lord. So for the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the nerds&#8217; lunch money. This was naturally a great incentive, and possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change, industrialization.</p>

<p>A great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial Revolution. But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, condition was that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace. [11] One piece of evidence is what happened to countries that tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor governments of the 1960s and early 1970s. Take away the incentive of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt.</p>

<p>Remember what a startup is, economically: a way of saying, I want to work faster. Instead of accumulating money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I want to get it over with as soon as possible. So governments that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing that you work slowly. They&#8217;re willing to let you earn $3 million over fifty years, but they&#8217;re not willing to let you work so hard that you can do it in two. They are like the corporate boss that you can&#8217;t go to and say, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times a much. Except this is not a boss you can escape by starting your own company.</p>

<p>The problem with working slowly is not just that technical innovation happens slowly. It&#8217;s that it tends not to happen at all. It&#8217;s only when you&#8217;re deliberately looking for hard problems, as a way to use speed to the greatest advantage, that you take on this kind of project. Developing new technology is a pain in the ass. It is, as Edison said, one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it. Engineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moon rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Startups are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in the last couple decades. Since it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has used essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage, where measurement comes from working with a small group, and leverage from developing new techniques. The recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is in Santa Clara today.</p>

<p>Understanding this may help to answer an important question: why Europe grew so powerful. Was it something about the geography of Europe? Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior? Was it their religion? The answer (or at least the proximate cause) may be that the Europeans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who made a lot of money to keep it.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;re allowed to do that, people who want to get rich can do it by generating wealth instead of stealing it. The resulting technological growth translates not only into wealth but into military power. The theory that led to the stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician. But because the Soviet Union didn&#8217;t have a computer industry, it remained for them a theory; they didn&#8217;t have hardware capable of executing the calculations fast enough to design an actual airplane.</p>

<p>In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as World War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history. Don&#8217;t let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world.</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>[1] One valuable thing you tend to get only in startups is uninterruptability. Different kinds of work have different time quanta. Someone proofreading a manuscript could probably be interrupted every fifteen minutes with little loss of productivity. But the time quantum for hacking is very long: it might take an hour just to load a problem into your head. So the cost of having someone from personnel call you about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.</p>

<p>This is why hackers give you such a baleful stare as they turn from their screen to answer your question. Inside their heads a giant house of cards is tottering.</p>

<p>The mere possibility of being interrupted deters hackers from starting hard projects. This is why they tend to work late at night, and why it&#8217;s next to impossible to write great software in a cubicle (except late at night).</p>

<p>One great advantage of startups is that they don&#8217;t yet have any of the people who interrupt you. There is no personnel department, and thus no form nor anyone to call you about it.</p>

<p>[2] Faced with the idea that people working for startups might be 20 or 30 times as productive as those working for large companies, executives at large companies will naturally wonder, how could I get the people working for me to do that? The answer is simple: pay them to.</p>

<p>Internally most companies are run like Communist states. If you believe in free markets, why not turn your company into one?</p>

<p>Hypothesis: A company will be maximally profitable when each employee is paid in proportion to the wealth they generate.</p>

<p>[3] Until recently even governments sometimes didn&#8217;t grasp the distinction between money and wealth. Adam Smith (Wealth of Nations, v:i) mentions several that tried to preserve their &#8220;wealth&#8221; by forbidding the export of gold or silver. But having more of the medium of exchange would not make a country richer; if you have more money chasing the same amount of material wealth, the only result is higher prices.</p>

<p>[4] There are many senses of the word &#8220;wealth,&#8221; not all of them material. I&#8217;m not trying to make a deep philosophical point here about which is the true kind. I&#8217;m writing about one specific, rather technical sense of the word &#8220;wealth.&#8221; What people will give you money for. This is an interesting sort of wealth to study, because it is the kind that prevents you from starving. And what people will give you money for depends on them, not you.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re starting a business, it&#8217;s easy to slide into thinking that customers want what you do. During the Internet Bubble I talked to a woman who, because she liked the outdoors, was starting an &#8220;outdoor portal.&#8221; You know what kind of business you should start if you like the outdoors? One to recover data from crashed hard disks.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the connection? None at all. Which is precisely my point. If you want to create wealth (in the narrow technical sense of not starving) then you should be especially skeptical about any plan that centers on things you like doing. That is where your idea of what&#8217;s valuable is least likely to coincide with other people&#8217;s.</p>

<p>[5] In the average car restoration you probably do make everyone else microscopically poorer, by doing a small amount of damage to the environment. While environmental costs should be taken into account, they don&#8217;t make wealth a zero-sum game. For example, if you repair a machine that&#8217;s broken because a part has come unscrewed, you create wealth with no environmental cost.</p>

<p>[5b] This essay was written before Firefox.</p>

<p>[6] Many people feel confused and depressed in their early twenties. Life seemed so much more fun in college. Well, of course it was. Don&#8217;t be fooled by the surface similarities. You&#8217;ve gone from guest to servant. It&#8217;s possible to have fun in this new world. Among other things, you now get to go behind the doors that say &#8220;authorized personnel only.&#8221; But the change is a shock at first, and all the worse if you&#8217;re not consciously aware of it.</p>

<p>[7] When VCs asked us how long it would take another startup to duplicate our software, we used to reply that they probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to at all. I think this made us seem naive, or liars.</p>

<p>[8] Few technologies have one clear inventor. So as a rule, if you know the &#8220;inventor&#8221; of something (the telephone, the assembly line, the airplane, the light bulb, the transistor) it is because their company made money from it, and the company&#8217;s PR people worked hard to spread the story. If you don&#8217;t know who invented something (the automobile, the television, the computer, the jet engine, the laser), it&#8217;s because other companies made all the money.</p>

<p>[9] This is a good plan for life in general. If you have two choices, choose the harder. If you&#8217;re trying to decide whether to go out running or sit home and watch TV, go running. Probably the reason this trick works so well is that when you have two choices and one is harder, the only reason you&#8217;re even considering the other is laziness. You know in the back of your mind what&#8217;s the right thing to do, and this trick merely forces you to acknowledge it.</p>

<p>[10] It is probably no accident that the middle class first appeared in northern Italy and the low countries, where there were no strong central governments. These two regions were the richest of their time and became the twin centers from which Renaissance civilization radiated. If they no longer play that role, it is because other places, like the United States, have been truer to the principles they discovered.</p>

<p>[11] It may indeed be a sufficient condition. But if so, why didn&#8217;t the Industrial Revolution happen earlier? Two possible (and not incompatible) answers: (a) It did. The Industrial Revolution was one in a series. (b) Because in medieval towns, monopolies and guild regulations initially slowed the development of new means of production.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK， 我们先写一段代码</p>

<pre><code>var g:Graphics = graphics;

var startX:Number = 100;
var startY:Number = 100;

var originX:Number = 125;
var originY:Number = 125;

g.beginFill(0xff0000);
g.drawRect(startX, startY, 300, 50);
g.endFill();

var shape:Shape = new Shape();
shape.x = startX;
shape.y = startY;

shape.graphics.beginFill(0x000000);
shape.graphics.drawRect(0, 0, 300, 50);
shape.graphics.endFill();

addChild(shape);
</code></pre>

<p>解释一下的话，就是以100,100为点画一个矩形，300, 50.
先用红色的画，再用黑色的画，之后我们要让shape绕着125,125点自转。</p>

<p>于是看起来的效果就是，红色的矩形作为标准，不动。
黑色的矩形绕着125,125自转。</p>

<p>开始转了</p>

<pre><code>var angle:Number = 10;
var raidan:Number = angle * (Math.PI/180);
var arr:Array = [Math.cos(radian), -Math.sin(radian), Math.sin(radian), Math.cos(radian)];

var timer:Timer = new Timer(1);

timer.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, function(e:Event):void
{
    shape.rotation += angle;

    var x1:Number = shape.x - originX;
    var y1:Number = shape.y - originY;

    var x:Number = arr[0] * x1 + arr[1] * y1;
    var y:Number = arr[2] * x1 + arr[3] * y1;

    shape.x = x + originX;
    shape.y = y + originY;
});

timer.start()
</code></pre>

<p>解释一下：
使用shape.rotation.rotation += angle
来旋转图形</p>

<p>但是这是围绕它本身的0,0点，也就是100, 100点旋转的，我们是要围绕125,125点旋转</p>

<p>其实，不管围绕哪一点旋转，转的角度都是一样，只是位移不一样，也就是shape的x y 坐标不同。
于是我们只需要移动x, y 坐标就行了。</p>

<p>既然我们是期望围绕125,125旋转，那么100,100点也得围绕125,125旋转，于是计算出了100,100点围绕125,125点旋转后的点
位移过去OK了。</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>由于比较喜欢GCC的东西，又必须做WIN下的程序，但是考虑到效率问题  <br/>
1，使用LINUX交叉编译MINGW下的程序  <br/>
2，直接使用MINGW和MSYS编译WIN程序</p>

<p>使用交叉编译的方法，在网上搜到的比较麻烦，而且又不是做嵌入式开发，必须用交叉编译;  <br/>
所以决定使用第二种方法。</p>

<p>目前已经成功编译了GDB7.4.1和最新的BINUTILS，还有MPC，MPFR，等GCC需要依赖的库。  <br/>
晚上回去看一下GCC4.7.0的编译情况。</p>

<p>不过在公司已经使用MINGW-GET拿到了GDB7.4和GCC4.6.2,而且使用正常。</p>

<p>目前是使用VIM做编辑器，使用EMACS做调试器（是不是有点小奢侈啊），幸好这两个神器都有WIN版本。</p>

<h1>感谢GNU，感谢上帝。</h1>

<p>2012-06-08</p>

<p>昨晚回去，出现了诡异的dllcrt2.o文件找不到的问题  <br/>
由于时间有限，又急着建立开发环境，所以决定把公司里使用mingw-get的版本拿回去。  <br/>
奇怪的是，家里使用mingw-get无法获取各种包，也就是不能用。</p>

<p>今天在公司，不甘心，利用业余时间终于把这个问题搞定。</p>

<p>网上也有人遇到这个问题，文件是有的，在/mingw/lib下</p>

<p>刚开始使用LDFLAGS无效，后来使用GCC_EXEC_PREFIX连configure都无法通过。</p>

<p>在这个命令的下面看到了，LIBRARY_PATH，于是灵光一现，配置好/mingw/lib</p>

<p>结果编译了一个下午, 公司的电脑还算好的。</p>

<p>自己编译GCC真不是玩的。花的时间太久了。</p>

<p>不过总算了解了自己的一个心病。</p>

<p>而且在网上差资料，关于dllcrt2.o的东西，都是外文。这里也算有个中文的关于这个的资料吧。</p>

<p>tips:</p>

<p>1, BINUTILS要使用最新版本，这个编译起来很快。  <br/>
要不然会出现unknown-pseudo .cfi_sections
2, 还有它依赖的其他库文件</p>

<p>其他问题就不大了，祝各位看官好运</p>
