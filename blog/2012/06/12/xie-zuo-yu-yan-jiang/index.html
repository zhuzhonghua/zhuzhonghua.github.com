<p>March 2012</p>

<p>我不是一个很好的演讲者。我经常“嗯”个不停。有时我没了思路, 不得不暂停。我希望我是一个好的演讲者。我也希望我是一个好的写作者, 但我不希望我是同样好的演讲者。我真正想要的是好的想法，这在写作中占的比重比在演讲中占的比重大。</p>

<p>如果要写好，就要有好想法。如果你知道你在说什么，你可以用最平常的话说出来，别人会认为你不错。但是，在演讲中，往往背道而驰：好的想法，只占演讲的一小部分，惊人的小。</p>

<p>我第一次意识到这一点，是几年前的一个会议上。当时另外一位演讲者比我好很多。他让我们所有人都开怀大笑。比较下来，我似乎很尴尬，僵硬。后来我把我的演讲内容放到网上，就像我平常做的那样。在我做这件事的时候，我试图回想那个人的谈话内容是什么样的，突然我意识到他并没有说什么具体内容。</p>

<p>对于知道如何演讲的人来说，也许这已经是很明显的了；但它给我一个提醒，想法在演讲中占的比重比在写作中占的比重小很多。 [1]</p>

<p>几年后，我听到一个人的一段话，他不止是一个比我好的演讲者，更是一个有名的演讲者。他非常棒。所以我决定密切关注他，了解他是怎样做到的。大约十句之后，我发现自己在想：“我不希望是一个好的演讲者。”</p>

<p>成为一个真正的好演讲者与好主意不仅仅是只有正交相似性，很多时候两者背道而驰。例如，当我要演讲时，我通常会先写出来。我知道这是一个错误，我知道进行事先写好的演讲，使得更难与听众交互。获得听众注意力的方式是，要把你所有的注意力都放在他们身上，当你进行事先写好的演讲时，你的注意力就被观众和演讲稿分散了，即使你记住了内容。如果你想与观众交互，最好是除了演讲内容的大纲和即兴的一些句子之外，不要有任何其它东西。但是，如果你这样做，你就没有更多时间思考你要说的每一句话。 现场演讲时，偶尔会有新想法；但一般来说，这不会像写作一样，产生好想法，那时你可以在每一句话上花费任意的时间。</p>

<p>如果你充分排练了一次预先写好的演讲，你就可以渐渐找到即兴演讲的感觉了。演员就是这样。但在流畅与想法之间有一个折中。练习演讲所用的时间，可以用来使演讲更好。演员不会面临这样的诱惑，除非在极少数情况下，他们自己写剧本，但演讲者要自己写剧本。演讲之前我会在一个角落里拿着打印纸，尝试在头脑中排练。但大部分的时间我都在重新写。所有我的讲稿，最终都会布满删除线，或被重写。这当然会让我经常停顿，因为我还没有任何时间来练习刚改的东西。</p>

<p>根据观众的不同，有时候会出现更糟糕的折中。观众喜欢被奉承，喜欢笑话; 他们喜欢激动人心的演讲词汇。当你降低了观众的智商时，好的演讲者就是好的忽悠者。写作中也会有这个问题，但是要比演讲更严重。一名观众要比一位读者要笨。随性演讲者只能花一点点时间来思考所说的话，观众也只有一点点时间来思考他听到的话。观众很容易被周围人的反应所影响，在人和人之间的这种传播很凶猛，就好像低音要比高音更易穿墙一样。每一位观众，都是早期的暴徒，一个好的演讲者利用了这点。那场会议中，那个演讲者的演讲也让我笑了，部分原因是别人都笑了。</p>

<p>所以说演讲没用么？作为思想的来源，肯定逊色于文字的。但是，演讲不是仅仅带来思想。我去听演讲是因为我对演讲者感兴趣。对于类似于总统这样的人，听演讲是接近这些人的最近的交流方式，他没有时间和每个想见他的人单独见面。</p>

<p>演讲也是激励我做事情的方式。所以这么多著名的演讲者都是励志演讲者。这可能是公众演讲的真谛。这也许是最初的目的。听演讲引发的情绪反应是一股强有力的力量。我希望我可以说，那种力量对于疾病也是有好处的，但是我不确。</p>

<p>=================================</p>

<p>Writing and Speaking</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a very good speaker. I say &#8220;um&#8221; a lot. Sometimes I have to pause when I lose my train of thought. I wish I were a better speaker. But I don&#8217;t wish I were a better speaker like I wish I were a better writer. What I really want is to have good ideas, and that&#8217;s a much bigger part of being a good writer than being a good speaker.</p>

<p>Having good ideas is most of writing well. If you know what you&#8217;re talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you&#8217;ll be perceived as having a good style. With speaking it&#8217;s the opposite: having good ideas is an alarmingly small component of being a good speaker.</p>

<p>I first noticed this at a conference several years ago. There was another speaker who was much better than me. He had all of us roaring with laughter. I seemed awkward and halting by comparison. Afterward I put my talk online like I usually do. As I was doing it I tried to imagine what a transcript of the other guy&#8217;s talk would be like, and it was only then I realized he hadn&#8217;t said very much.</p>

<p>Maybe this would have been obvious to someone who knew more about speaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less ideas mattered in speaking than writing. [1]</p>

<p>A few years later I heard a talk by someone who was not merely a better speaker than me, but a famous speaker. Boy was he good. So I decided I&#8217;d pay close attention to what he said, to learn how he did it. After about ten sentences I found myself thinking &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a good speaker.&#8221;</p>

<p>Being a really good speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas, but in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction. For example, when I give a talk I usually write it out beforehand. I know that&#8217;s a mistake; I know delivering a prewritten talk makes it harder to engage with an audience. The way to get the attention of an audience is to give them your full attention, and when you&#8217;re delivering a prewritten talk your attention is always divided between the audience and the talk—even if you&#8217;ve memorized it. If you want to engage an audience it&#8217;s better to start with no more than an outline of what you want to say and ad lib the individual sentences. But if you do that you could spend no more time thinking about each sentence than it takes to say it. [2] Occasionally the stimulation of talking to a live audience makes you think of new things, but in general this is not going to generate ideas as well as writing does, where you can spend as long on each sentence as you want.</p>

<p>If you rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you can get asymptotically close to the sort of engagement you get when speaking ad lib. Actors do. But here again there&#8217;s a tradeoff between smoothness and ideas. All the time you spend practicing a talk, you could instead spend making it better. Actors don&#8217;t face that temptation except in the rare cases where they&#8217;ve written the script, but any speaker does. Before I give a talk I can usually be found sitting in a corner somewhere with a copy printed out on paper, trying to rehearse it in my head. But I always end up spending most of the time rewriting it instead. Every talk I give ends up being given from a manuscript full of things crossed out and rewritten. Which of course makes me um even more, because I haven&#8217;t had any time at all to practice the new bits. [3]</p>

<p>Depending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs than these. Audiences like to be flattered; they like jokes; they like to be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words. As you decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter. That&#8217;s true in writing too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks. Any given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader. Just as a speaker ad libbing can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to say it, a person hearing a talk can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to hear it. Plus people in an audience are always affected by the reactions of those around them, and the reactions that spread from person to person in an audience are disproportionately the more brutish sort, just as low notes travel through walls better than high ones. Every audience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that. Part of the reason I laughed so much at the talk by the good speaker at that conference was that everyone else did. [4]</p>

<p>So are talks useless? They&#8217;re certainly inferior to the written word as a source of ideas. But that&#8217;s not all talks are good for. When I go to a talk, it&#8217;s usually because I&#8217;m interested in the speaker. Listening to a talk is the closest most of us can get to having a conversation with someone like the president, who doesn&#8217;t have time to meet individually with all the people who want to meet him.</p>

<p>Talks are also good at motivating me to do things. It&#8217;s probably no coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as motivational speakers. That may be what public speaking is really for. It&#8217;s probably what it was originally for. The emotional reactions you can elicit with a talk can be a powerful force. I wish I could say that force was more often used for good than ill, but I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>[1] I&#8217;m not talking here about academic talks, which are a different type of thing. While the audience at an academic talk might appreciate a joke, they will (or at least should) make a conscious effort to see what new ideas you&#8217;re presenting.</p>

<p>[2] That&#8217;s the lower bound. In practice you can often do better, because talks are usually about things you&#8217;ve written or talked about before, and when you ad lib you end up reproducing some of those sentences. Like early medieval architecture, impromptu talks are made of spolia. Which feels a bit dishonest, incidentally, because you have to deliver these sentences as if you&#8217;d just thought of them.</p>

<p>[3] Robert Morris points out that there is a way in which practicing talks makes them better: reading a talk out loud can expose awkward parts. I agree and in fact I read most things I write out loud at least once for that reason.</p>

<p>[4] For sufficiently small audiences, it may not be true that being part of an audience makes people dumber. The real decline seems to set in when the audience gets too big for the talk to feel like a conversation—maybe around 10 people.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sam Altman and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.</p>
