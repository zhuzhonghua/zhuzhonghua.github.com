<a href="http://www.paulgrahamcn.com/article/start">如何开始创业</a>

一次成功的创业建立在以下三个条件上：优秀的合伙人，确实有需求的产品，以及尽可能少的启动资金。绝大部分创业失败是因为它们缺少了以上这些条件中的某一项，而那些完全具备这三点的创业往往会取得成功。



让人欣慰的是，当你认真考虑它们的时候，这三点条件都是可行的，虽然可能有一点困难。鉴于成功的创业应该会让创始人富有，我们可以得出结论：富有的生活是可以实现的，只是有一点困难。



如果说在创业方面只有一点我想要澄清的话，那就是：创业时，并没有需要特别出众的才华才能踏出的，神奇的一步。



创意



特别需要指出的是，创业并不需要特别优秀的创意。创业的主旨是通过给人们提供比他们现在拥有的东西更好一点的商品，以次货的需求。可是很多人们现在拥有的产品和服务是如此之差，以至于不需要多聪明的头脑都能想出将之改善的方法。



以Google为例，开始时的计划仅仅是创造一个简单易用不至于烂得让人骂娘的搜索引擎。为此他们做了三点创新：链接更多网页，对搜索结果进行排序，以及使用不带骚扰广告的清新简洁的界面，因此总而言之，他们制作了一个很好用的网站。Google网站的技术含量是无庸置疑的，而总体计划更是直截了当。当现在他们已经有了巨大得多的野心和发展时，这种简单的计划给他们带来一年10亿美元的收益。



世上还有许许多多的领域，和在Google出现之前的网络搜索领域一样落后。我可以想出好几种启发创业思路的方法，不过绝大部分归结于以下的方式：观察人们的某些行为和需求，并找出满足他们需要而又不是太差的一种技术或手段。



举例来说，目前那些约会网站做得比Google出现之前的网络搜索服务还要糟糕得多。他们都使用同样简单的架构，倾向于用数据配对来代替真实世界的约会的重要性，水平甚至还不如一个大学生为了应付课程而做的作业。与此同时，还有很多的资金可以投注到这一领域，约会网站是一个很有价值的生意，并且有可能通过成功的运作得到百倍以上的回报。



一个良好的创意，只是创业的第一步。许多未来的创业者认为，整个创业的过程只是最初的那个主意，以及剩下的执行细节。而风险投资方对此有更清晰的了解，当一个创业者来到风投公司要求用他的创意换取进一步合作的时候，他甚至得不到一份保密协议。很显然，一个纯粹的创意的市场价值，甚至不如签订一份保密协议的成本。



原始创意不值钱的另一个例证是，很多的创业者在其实践过程中对他们原本的计划做了很大的修改。微软创始时的经营计划是贩卖编程语言等软件，而他们现在的商业模式是在创业五年后被IBM扫地出门之后诞生的。



创意绝对是有价值的，但问题在于，它们很难在创业过程中转变为收益。创意不是那种很容易让别人按照你的思路去执行的东西，它们的价值在于其拥有者在实践中对原始计划不断思考和修正的过程。



创意并不是最重要的东西，那些拥有创意的人才是。善于工作的人可以把一个烂主意变好，可是再好好主意也帮不了一个笨蛋。



人



我指的善于工作的人是什么样的呢？在我创业的过程中学到的最有用的东西，就是雇佣员工的标准。你能够明白“猛兽一般的人”这个比喻吗？这句话可能很难翻译成其它语言，不过我认为每个美国人都明白它的意思。这是说，某些人对于他们的工作有点过于认真，以至于他们在工作的过程中跨过了职业需求的限度而进入到狂热的境界。



对于单个人而言，这个比喻确切的意思取决于工作性质的不同：一个绝不接受客人说不的推销员；一个在凌晨四点也不愿意留下代码中的bug去睡觉的黑客；一个会冷不防打电话到纽约时报记者手机的公共关系专家；一个看到两毫米的误差就会觉得浑身不舒服的设计师。



在我的公司里，几乎每个人都是一头猛兽。我的销售主管，那个女人的顽强甚至让我对她电话另一头的潜在客户感到歉意。你都可以感受到他们在电话现那头挣扎，像鱼钩上的鱼一样，但是在签约之前，他们绝对不会得到任何逃跑的机会。



想一想你所认识的人，你会发现“猛兽”形态是很容易找到的。想象某些人的样子，然后在心里描绘下他们做那些“猛兽般”行为的状态。如果你发笑了，说明他们不是那样的人。在一个大公司中，这样的状态可能是不必要甚至不需要的，但在创业中，“猛兽”般的工作态度是绝对必须的。



对于黑客，我们有一些额外的标准。他确实特别聪明吗？如果是，他能够一丝不扣地完成一份工作吗？还有最后，鉴于部分很优秀的黑客会有一些不良癖好，我们是否能够忍受他们和我们一起工作也是指标之一。



而最后的测试只能筛选掉很少一部分人。我们可以接受一个天才的任何缺点，除了不断抱怨的那些。不过这些人通常不怎么优秀，所以我们的第三个测试基本上只是之前的补充。



大部分情况下，当那些讨厌的人努力装聪明的时候，他们会变得让人难以容忍。其实，越是聪明的人越是不会为此感到困扰。所以你会发现，那些充满天才的人总是较易使用“我不知道”“也许你是对的”和“我对xx事情不太了解”这类的句式。



这种技巧并不是一直有用的，因为人很容易受到环境的影响。在MIT的顾客满意部门，好像有一种叫做“装成一个什么都知道的猛男”的传统。听说这种态度最早起源于Marvin Minsky，而与此相类似的所谓典型飞行员姿态，则是来自于Chuck Yeager。就算是真正才华出众的人，在这个环境里也会显得有点太猛，所以你只能忍受他们。



这种人才选择方式让我们拥有Robert Morris了，我所见过最会说“我不知道”的一个人。（至少在他成为MIT的教授之前）。没有人会对Robert有所抱怨，因为他显然比任何人都要聪明，难得的是还没有任何脾气。



就像绝大部分创业活动一样，我们公司最初的合伙人仅仅是一群好朋友，而且连员工的招聘都主要通过朋友关系来进行。这是创业公司和大企业最显著的区别。和某人交几天朋友，能体会到大公司在面试中永远问不出的东西。



创业大半发生在大学周围，是因为那里是有才智的人的聚集地。MIT和斯坦福周围布满了高科技公司，并不是因为他们的学生在课堂上学到的东西。其实只要学校允许，他们宁可在课堂上唱野营歌。



如果你想要创业，和大学里的天才们一起进行会带来更好的机会，所以理论上来说你要努力和你在大学里看到的每一个聪明人交朋友，对吗？答案是不。优秀的技术人员不喜欢目的性很强的交流方式，你的努力不会有回报。



在大学里，你该做的是专注于你自己的项目。就算你不想创业，一个好的技术人员也应该做到这一点，因为这是唯一能够真正学会程序技术的方式。在某些项目里你将会和别的学生合作，而这是最好的结识优秀黑客的方法。有些项目可能会进化成一个值得创业的机会，不过我建议不要对此太过执着。别强制自己做任何事，只要和你欣赏的人一起做喜欢的工作就行了。



理想状态下，你会需要2至4个合作者。只有两个人的创业是很困难的。而单独创业者，将会发现自己面临着巨大的精神压力。即使是比尔大门，传说中无视压力的名人，仍然需要找一个合作者一起创业。不过你确实不需要像一张全家福照片一样多的合作伙伴，一方面是因为创业初期并不需要太多人，另一方面是因为越多人就越多分歧。在只有两三个人的情况下，你们会因为失败的压力迅速地处理不同意见。而7、8个人一起干的时候，任何分歧都可能长时间逗留并造成分裂的小团体。投票表决并不是好方法，全体一致才是创业的需要。



很多情况下，一个新公司都是基于技术型产业而建立，所以创始人需要招收技术人员。在网络泡沫时代，很多商科出身的创业者寻求优秀黑客的帮助来制造他们的产品，其结果被证明并不理想。生意人对于技术问题并不理解，因为他们不知道产品的发展有哪些可选项，会面临什么困难，有什么优势。而且他们也分不清哪个黑客更优秀，就算对于计算机领域的同业，人们也很难分清谁更优秀的问题，而一个单纯的生意人在挑选的时候就更像一场轮盘赌了。



那么在创业时，商科背景的人是否是必须的呢？这个问题并没有确定的答案。当我创业的时候，我们认为是需要的，所以我们向周围的专业人士询问关于“商场的奥秘”的知识以及他们愿不愿意做我们的总经理。不过他们都拒绝了，所以我只能自己来当。不过后来我发现，做生意也没有那么困难和神秘，并不像物理学或者医学那样需要大量的学习，只要努力让别人买你的东西就好了。



我认为，之前我把做生意看成是很神秘的东西，原因在于我本身对它有厌恶感。我希望在纯净而高度脑力化的软件世界中工作，而不是和庸俗的客户及他们的蠢问题打交道。不希望参与某项工作的人往往会用一种保护性的能力不足来作推脱。Paul Erdos是很典型的例子，人们看到他甚至不懂得如何把一颗柚子切成两半。所以别人不得不为他做所有的生活琐事，从而让他能够把自己的全部时间投注在数学商。Erdos是一个极端的例子，不过绝大多数做丈夫的或多或少使用相同的手段。



当我必须放弃我的保护性能力不足之后，我发现做生意并不像我之前想象的那么困难和无聊。生意经中有很深奥的部分，例如税法和衍生产品的定价，但你无需在创业的时候掌握它们。所有创业所需要的知识在任何商学院甚至大学建立起来之前就已经被人们所熟知了。



如果你尝试在福布斯400强的管理者名单中标记出MBA学历的名字，你就会对商学院有新的重要认识。第一个MBA在第22位出现，Phil Knight，Nike的CEO。前50名中只有4个MBA学历，而相对的，福布斯400强中的管理者有相当大一部分是技术背景的。想想Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore，高科技类产业的规则看起来是由技术员而非生意人制定的。所以如果你希望用两年的时间给你未来的创业增添一点资本，学会一点黑客技术看上去比读MBA更有用。



有一个重要理由会让你希望把一个商科背景的人加入到创业的队伍中：总要有个人愿意并且能够关注客户的需求。有些人认为，只有商科背景的人能做这件事。优秀黑客能够制作软件，不过不能设计它们。这种话及其荒谬。黑客没有理由因为懂得设计软件就不理解客户需求，纯正的生意人也没有理由不懂得设计软件却能神奇地理解它们。



无论如何，如果你不能靠自己探寻客户需求，你就必须寻找一个能够这么做的合伙人。这是技术创业中最最重要的一环，绝大部分的创业是因为这个环节而失败的。



客户需求



并不是只有创业公司需要担心客户需求。我认为绝大部分公司失败的主要原因就是他们不能给客户提供想要的东西。以餐馆为例，绝大多数餐馆最终经营失败，其中约有四分之一甚至在第一年就关门大吉。可是你记得曾经有哪一家能做出真正美味的食物的餐馆倒闭吗？



餐馆只要能做出真正美味的食物就足以应付一切。优秀的口味带来高昂的价格，拥挤的人群，喧嚣，热闹的氛围，坐满的座位，甚至态度恶劣的服务，而顾客们还是趋之若鹜。当然确实存在一些口味一般而靠小噱头吸引顾客的餐厅，但这样的经营方式会带来很大的风险。直接提供美味可口的食物才是最为简单有效的方法。



在技术创业中，情况也是一样。你可能听说过创业失败的各种理由，可是有听说过拥有一个极端受欢迎的产品的公司失败的例子么？



几乎每一个失败的创业案例，最终的问题都是其客户失去了对其产品的需求。基本上，所有的失败看起来都是由“资金不足”所直接导致的，可是他们弄不到资金的原因几乎都一样：产品太烂，或者根本就没有一个完成的产品。



当我列出所有创业者都需要做的工作的时候，曾经很想要尽快作出一个产品的第一版。幸好我没有决定这么做，因为这种急功近利的方法不利于做出顾客想要的产品。只有通过发行试用版并根据客户反馈不断调整，才是创造出适合客户需求的产品的唯一方法。



另一个方法是我称为“孤注一掷”(Hail Mary)的策略。你可能对一个产品做出详细的计划书，雇佣一整队的工程师来开发它，一年之后发现你投入的二百万美元变成了一堆没人要的垃圾。在网络泡沫的时代，这种情况并不少见，尤其在那些商业气息很浓的公司进入计算机技术领域的时候，他们都以为开发软件产品是一件可以完美地按照计划进行的事情。



我们从不认同这种做法。作为一个LISP流的黑客，我遵循着快速原型开发的传统。并不是说这种方法是用于开发任何程序（至少不在这篇文章里），不过这种方法对创业阶段需要的软件而言是绝对必要的。



就像大部分创业公司一样，我们进入实际操作阶段以后对我们的计划进行了修改。一开始我们的目标客户是网络咨询公司，可是他们显然不喜欢我们，因为我们的软件使用过于简单又配有自己的站点，他们的客户甚至可以直接把他们炒掉。我们认为还可以做一些网上目录供应商的生意，因为网上销售可以成为他们现有生意的良好扩展。不过在1996年，这种生意很难做。公司的中层管理人往往把网络营销视为一项多出来的工作，而不是一个机会。



我们得到了一些有进取精神的需要目录服务的公司的订单。其中还包括Frederick's of Hollywood，那巨大的工作量真是对我们的服务能力的一大考验。不过大部分的客户都是些小公司，希望在网络上寻求机遇的个体商户。有一些客户拥有自己的商店，不过大部分都只在网上销售。所以我们把目标转向这些小商贩来取代原本计划中的网络咨询公司和大型零售商，也因此我们需要把软件做得更简单易用。



从这些经验中，我学会了一个重要原则。使你的技术易于使用是永远值得花精力去做的事。黑客们已经习惯于和电脑打交道所以不了解普通人对于不熟悉的软件怀有的恐惧心理Stephen Hawking（霍金，译注）的编辑告诉他，他每在书里放进一个公式，书的销量就会减少一半。当你致力于使你的技术易于使用时，这条曲线将随着你使软件简化的程度往上倾斜。易用性方面10%的进步，会带来的收益将是两倍的销量而不是仅仅10%的增长。



那要如何探寻客户的需求呢？观察。展销会是观察客户的最佳选择之一，它们往往不是用来争取新客户的，而是用来做市场调查的。在展销会上我们并不仅仅做一些简单的演示，我们还教客户建设自己的网上上铺的方法。同时我们能够观察他们使用我们软件的情况，以及和他们讨论关于产品的进一步需求。



大部分人把创业当成建设一家像苹果或谷歌那样的公司来看待。这些公司名气响亮，人尽皆知。但对于任何一个创业公司来说，在利基市场（类似于细分市场，长尾概念）上或者基础工业领域中还有20个以上可以成就大事业的机会。所以当你希望创业成功的时候，最好把赌注投注在这些方面。



从另一个角度来说，在已经有一个强大的品牌产品的市场中创业，成功的几率是相当小的。在“蓝海”（参见长尾理论）中才有最好的创业机会。因为创业的基本原则是给人们提供比他们现在使用的东西更好一点的产品，所以那些目前水平低下的产业中才蕴藏着最好的机会。相信我，你不会找到一个比大公司的IT部门的工作更烂水平的领域了，那些企业每年花费巨资在使用的软件上，可是回报却是一大堆的麻烦。这种不公平的现象意味着巨大的机遇。



如果你想要找一个创业的机会，你可以尝试找一个中等规模的非技术公司待几个星期，专注于观察他们和电脑应用有关的活动。大部分优秀的黑客都不能够理解普通的公司员工对于电脑的恐惧心理，就像美国的富人们无法理解巴西贫民窟发生了什么一样。



当创业开始的时候，尝试为小公司写一些适合他们的软件，因为这样更容易卖出去。给大公司提供比他们现有的垃圾系统更好一点的垃圾软件，是一件很花时间和金钱的工作。就算你可以用一只手黑掉Oracle的系统，你也不可能竞争过他们的销售人员。所以如果你希望用你较为优秀的技术水平争夺客户，先从小公司做起。



从战略上来说，小公司业务更适合创业中的企业发展。在技术领域，低端产品总能侵蚀高端市场。把一些便宜货改的好一些，其难度远小于把那些更好的软件改的便宜一些。所以低端出身的产品经过市场中的发展和创新，会逐渐地进步到可以打入高端市场的境界。Sun公司的主机就是其中的典范，而Intel在和Sun合作的过程中完成这个过程，微软的Word软件通过插页和设计框架的简单功能打入桌面文件处理软件的竞争中，大众型的数码相机生产商也会制作供给专业人士的昂贵玩具。Avid在录像处理系统中的发展，Apple紧随其后的成长，Henry Ford在已经被遥遥领先的汽车制造业中的成功，都是依靠这种模式。一种便宜而好用的产品，不仅是你创造销售额的利器，而且能够帮助你开拓更大的市场份额。



如果有任何竞争对手的价格和易用性比你的产品优越，那你就要当心成为别人的靶子了。



筹集资金



要使任何创业活动实现，你首先需要的就是启动资金。有些创业公司是自给自足的，比如微软，但绝大部分做不到。我认为明智的做法是寻找适当的投资人，因为依靠自有资金创业，你基本上只能做一个咨询类的公司，而这类型的业务很难转换成一个实业行的事业。



从资本角度考虑，创业就像一场考试。创业致富的方法并不是占有全部的股份，而是尽可能地最大化公司成功的机会。所以较好的做法是用一些股份来换取更高的成功几率。



对于大部分职业黑客而言，寻找投资者是一件神秘而可怕的事情。其实让我说，这只是一项简单乏味的工作。首先你需要几万美元的启动资金来开发你的软件的原型的费用。这种投资称为“种子资金”，只是小额的投资，而获取它们其实也很简单：只要开口问别人行不行就是了。



一般而言，你可以从那些独立投资人那里获取种子资金，这种投资称为“天使投资”，投资人往往是曾经靠技术创业成功的人士。在种子阶段，投资人并不要求你有一个详细的商业计划，他们会根据你的介绍做出快速的决定，有时资金在一周内就会到位——只要一份简单的合同。



我们启动Viaweb的资金是从我们的朋友Julian那里得来的一万美元天使投资，而且他还给了我们更多的帮助。身为企业律师的他曾经是一个公司的ＣＥＯ，所以我们从他那里得到了很多关于做生意的建议，还省去了我们处理自己的法律问题的麻烦。另外，他还带给我们另两位天使投资人，解决了我们下一步的资金问题。



有些天使投资者，尤其是那些有技术背景的人，可能会只凭一个测试版的软件或者一次口头说明就相信你的创业计划。但是大部分投资人都会想要一份详细的计划书来搞明白他们到底投资了什么。



回想起来，当时我们的天使投资人问我要商业计划的时候，我确实为它发了好多的愁。“商业计划”，它显然涉及到“商业”这个新奇的玩意，所以我觉得我得参考一些相关的书籍来学习怎样写好它，但是从书中却完全找不到答案。基本上，投资人会希望你给他们一个大体的描述包括你想做什么和它能怎样赚钱，还有你自己的简历。你只要坐下把你曾经告诉过别人的那些希望写下来就好了。这件事情其实不需要花一整天去做，最重要的是你还能在写下你的计划的过程中得到许多的启发。



得到投资以后，你要做的是建立一家公司。大致上开办一家公司并不困难，但问题在于你很难决定哪些人会成为你的合作伙伴以及你们各占多少股份。两个同等水平的人平分并不困难，但是当你有好几个在工作在不同领域和层次的合伙人的时候，合理分配股份将是无比痛苦的。不过无论如何，只要你们决定好了，这件事情就不能改变。



对于这件事，我没有什么好的建议。我只能说，你该尽力去做，努力做好它。不过实在要说的话，我有一个实践中的经验就是，当每个人都觉得他们得到的股份相对于他们的付出而言算是吃了一点小亏的时候，你的股权分配方式是最好的。



当然除了合作之外，开办一家公司还有很多事情要做。保险，营业执照，劳动补偿，和国税局打交道。我不太清楚还有什么事情在清单上，因为我们的公司完全跳过了这些玩意。。1996年当我们得到了足以创业的投资时，我们也得到了一个了不起的CFO，他把一切安排的妥妥帖帖的。不管怎么说，就算你没有把开办公司时该做的每件事都完成，也不会有人冲过来把你逮捕归案。对于创业者而言这真是天大的好事，不然鬼还敢去创业。



如果你得到投资又不能及时开办公司，你的部分合伙人将会有自己先出去单干的想法。这种事经常发生，而它对你们而言是很危险的。所以当你决定创业并分配好股权的时候，你应该让所有的合伙人签署一份将所有人的创意所有权归属于公司的协议，以保证每个人都只能为公司服务。



(如果我们在演电影，接下来的场景将会伴随着不祥的音乐）



当你这么做的时候，首先你要问清楚每个合伙人他们还签署过什么协议。对于创业公司而言最麻烦的问题之一就是知识产权问题。我们曾经有过，而它差点就把我们搞垮了，比任何一个竞争对手都更接近。。。



当我们正要被别的公司收购的关键时期，我们发现一个合伙人早些时候签署了一份将他的创意所有权交给某大公司以换取进入大学的助学金的协议。理论上来说，这份玩意说明别人在我们的软件产权中占了很大的一份。所以我们不得不对收购行动采取急刹车来应付这一问题。鉴于我们即将被收购，当时我们的现金流降低到一个很低的水平，而这个问题使我们不得不补充资金以维持公司的运行。可是当你们公司头上有知识产权问题存在的时候是很难找到投资者的，没人愿意冒着个险。



我们当时的投资人得知我们现金短缺之后，立刻进行了一些针对性的活动。我并不想在这里详述，除了告诉各位所谓“天使投资”，仅仅是名字好听而已。创始人被要求在留下详细的服务器操作方法给投资人之后离开公司，而当这种事情发生时，收购企业把它当成压价的砝码。



这些问题最后奇迹般地得到解决。投资人回来了；我们的公司得到了新的估价；而那个大公司给出一份对我们的软件不拥有产权的声明；而6个月以后我们被Yahoo以比前一家公司搞得多的价格收购。所以这还算是个皆大欢喜的结局，虽然我的寿命可能因为这次事件被缩短了几年。



别犯我们的错误，在你开始创业之前搞清每个合伙人的知识产权归属问题。



当你建立你的公司以后，可能你会觉得，去敲有钱人家的门，请求他们为你们的小主意提供上万的贷款，是一件很冒昧的事情。不过如果你站在有钱人的立场上看，这件事情是很容易实现的。他们都在寻求良好的投资机会，如果你的项目真的有钱赚，实际上他们很愿意提供资金。甚至他们可能这样想：这家伙会成为下一个Google吗？



通常天使投资金对创业者而言是一桩公平的买卖。他们和你分享股权及远期收益，而他们的股份取决于你对自己公司的预期。如果你用百分之X的股权换取Y的资金，这意味着你对整个公司的定价。例如，如果你用5%股权来换取10万美元，那意味着你的公司的价值是2百万美元。



至于你如何判断自己公司的价值，并没有一个固定的方法。某种意义上来说，创业公司就是一场赌博。当我创业的时候，我并没有认识到这点。Julian认为我们应该把公司定价几百万美元，而我认为把当时我们仅有的几千行代码换算成几百万美元是一件荒唐的事。最后我们把公司定位于100万，因为Julian说没有人回味了价值一百万以下的公司投资。



那时我还没有了解到，我们公司的价值并不取决于我们当时所写的代码。它还取决于我们正确的思路和创意，以及之后我们付出的诸多努力。



筹集资金的下一步是接触真正的风险投资公司。不过不要等到你的钱都快见底了才找他们，风投做出决策是很慢的，他们需要花几个月。而当你和他们周旋的时候，最好不要现金短缺。



从风投那里搞钱比从天时投资人那里搞钱麻烦得多。资金数额通常上百万，所以整场交易需要你更多的时间和精力，来面对更繁重的工作。



有时候风投会希望在公司里设置一个他们选定的CEO，因为他们会觉得你需要一个有商业背景，成熟稳重的领导者。也许有时候这是对的，不过比尔大门兄白手起家的时候又没有经验又没有商科背景，而看上去他混得很好。乔布斯用了一个成熟稳重有商业背景的人来管理他的公司，结果差点毁了它。所以我认为那些所谓成熟稳重有商业背景的家伙们得到了过高的估计。我们曾经把他们称为“播新闻的”，因为他们都梳着干净的头发，用一种深沉而自信的声音讲话，而且除了提词装置上显示的话之外什么都不知道。



我们和不少风投接触过，但最后决定完全依靠天使投资金进行我们的创业。主要是因为我们害怕一个名牌风投公司会用一个新闻播报员来收拾我们。如果他只是在那里摆摆样子，那还好。可要是他想要干涉公司运行怎么办？这将会造成一场灾难，我们的软件太复杂了，他根本不可能弄懂。我们公司的核心价值都在先进的技术上，因此基本上所有的战略决策都是依据与我们的技术发展的，对此我们不需要外行人多嘴多舌。



这也是当时我们的软件没有上市的原因之一。在1998年我们的CFO曾经建议我做这件事。那时候你可以通过做一个类似于狗粮专卖的门户网站来成为一家优秀的售卖有利润的真实产品的上市公司。不过我害怕这会导致我们搞来一个播新闻的，那种所谓“有华尔街腔调的人”。



我很高兴看到Google给了这种趋势一个嘴巴。他们上市的时候根本不理睬所谓的华尔街强调，而华尔街的投资者也不买他们的股票，现在华尔街的所有人都想要踢自己的屁股了。他们会学会重视下次机会的，有利可图的事情他们总是学的很快。



你会有很多的机会和风投们打交道，比你想的要多得多。因为这世界上有很多很多的风头公司，而根据我跟他们打交道的经验——你也会学到的——这完全是个卖方市场。就算现在，市场上也有无穷多的空闲资金在寻找优秀的投资机会。



风投公司是金字塔型的，在顶端有像Sequoia和Kleiner Perkins这样的名人，但是其下有许许多多你听都没听到过的家伙，其共同点就是他们的一块钱就是值一块钱。大部分风投的人会告诉你，他们不仅提供资金，还提供关系和建议，如果你是在和Vinod Khosla或John Doerr或Mike Moritz谈交易，这是没错的。不过这些建议和关系是很昂贵的，而你会发现他们的手下不同层级的人按照职位大小其智商直线下降。从金字塔的顶端下来一点你就会不得不和那些只懂从Wired杂志上获取新知识的银行家谈生意了。（你们的产品使用XML么？）（不明白，程序员才懂的蠢话吧，总之就是火星人的意思，译注）所以我建议你们对所谓的经验和关系的价值保持怀疑态度。基本上，风投只是资金的来源，我倾向于和任何最快提供资金的人谈生意。



你可能不知道该告诉风投多少关于你们的情况。鉴于他们可能有一天投资于你的竞争对手，你应该尽量诚恳。良好的计划不需要藏头露尾，不过也不需要抬头名。总而言之，就像许多风投说的，他们对于创业者的兴趣大于对项目的兴趣。他们和你谈你的计划主要是为了评价你这个人，而不是你的创意。所以只要你表现得明白你在做什么，你也可以保留一点隐私。



和尽量多的风投交流，即使你不想要他们的钱。因为：a）他们可能带来希望收购你的公司的人， b）如果你表现得很强势，他们就不敢投资到你们的竞争对手身上去。如果你只是想让他们认识一下你而不是问他们要钱，接触风投最有效率的方式是，在某些创业公司的展销会上向他们展示。



当你真的得到了启动资金以后，该如何使用呢？尽量节省着用，这是我的建议。几乎每场失败的创业都是直接因为资金断档造成的。当然其中可能有很多深层次的原因，但是这个最的直接原因是我们应该努力避免的。



在网络泡沫时期，几乎每个创业公司都想着“快快搞大”。理想状态下这意味着尽快争取到更多客户，但实际操作的时候却很容易演变成马上雇佣很多员工。就算你能避免如果你能争取到许多客户，那敢情好，可是这种期望往往是不切实际的。人们总是想要第一个进占市场然后囊括所有客户，一点空间都不留给竞争对手。不过我认为在绝大部分生意中先入优势都不会大到这种境界。我们再次以Google为例，当他们创始的时候搜索引擎市场看上去是一个垄断市场，大企业依靠百万美金的营销创立他们的品牌效应：Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista, Inktomi。显然1998年对于加入搜索引擎的竞争是太晚了一点。



不过Google的创始人们发现，品牌在搜索领域几乎没有什么价值可言。你只要在任何一点上能做出更好的产品，用户们就会蜂拥而至。作为对这一观点的佐证，Google从来不打广告。他们就像一家经销商，销售那些自己也乐于使用的产品。



Google超越的那些竞争者们如果将百万美元花在提升软件水平上，可能还会取得更好一些的成绩。对于未来的创业者而言这是一个很好的警示，除非你处于一个产品没有本质差异的市场上，例如香烟雪茄洗涤剂之类，不然，做一大堆广告只说明你的业务正变得越来越差。而网络业务不应该会有什么很类似的产品，那些约会网站猛打广告，正说明他们快要完蛋了。(Fee, fie, fo, fum,我闻到这些公司背后市场营销总监的体味了）



受环境所迫，我们公司的业务成长缓慢，但回头看来却是好事一件。每个创始人都充分掌握了公司的每项工作。除了写软件，我还必须做销售和客户服务的工作。销售业务并不好做，我虽然一直在坚持，但明显我没有一个优秀的推销员所需要的那种耐心和诚恳。我给潜在客户提供的信息是：你不在网上做销售实在太愚蠢了，如果你要在网上做销售，不用我们的软件同样是很愚蠢的。这些信息都是正确的，但显然不能让客人感到愉快。



不过我很擅长做客户服务的工作。想象一下，一个客服不仅对产品知无不详，而且在产品存在bug的时候还会发自内心地道歉，并立刻在和你打电话的时间内修好它。客户们简直爱死我们了，当然我们也很爱他们。因为当你只能通过口耳相传来发展的时候，你的第一批客户一定是那些主动发掘到你的优点的聪明人。在创业的早期阶段，没有什么比有头脑的客户更有价值的了。如果你倾听他们的话，他们能告诉你们很多提升你们产品的竞争力的方法。除了给你这些免费的建议，他们还正在付给你可爱的美金。



我们的公司在1996年正式启动，到年底的时候我们有了大约70个客户。鉴于当时是“快快搞大”的年代，我对我们公司的弱小很是担忧。不过事实上我们的发展方向才是正确的，太快的做大会让你的公司难以转向。第一年是我们提升产品质量的好时机，到了年底的时候我们的产品质量已经远远超过竞争对手的想象了。而且因为每个公司里的黑客们都已经有了充分的客户交流体验，我们对于网络营销的理解远超任何对手。



这些条件是我们创业成功的基石。没有比真正理解你的生意更重要的事了。你可能以为任何做生意的人理所当然的应该理解自己的业务，其实不然。Google成功的秘诀可以简单地归纳为，他们了解搜索业务。当他们创业的时候我正在为Yahoo工作，而我知道Yahoo不明白搜索这件事，因为有一次我尝试告诉公司高层我们拥有更好的搜索系统的必要性，而我从内线得到了这样的回复：我们Yahoo不要再只做一个“搜索引擎”了，搜索业务只是我们网络业务的一小部分，贡献还达不到我们一个月的增长率。我们已经是一家“传媒企业”，“门户网站”，或者其它什么高级玩意，搜索业务有没有都无所谓，就跟脐带一样剪掉也没关系。



确实，搜索业务只是整个页面中很小的一部分，但那是很重要的一部分，因为那是网络服务的起点。我想，Yahoo现在学到这一点了。



绝大部分网络服务商不明白的事，Google却了然于心。第一条就是，就算广告商付钱给你而用户是免费的，你也必须把用户放在广告商之前。我最喜欢的一张保险杠贴纸上写着，“如果群众开始自主，那领导者只能跟随。”。引用到网络业务中，这句话可以改成“争取到所有的用户，广告就会挤破你的门槛”。所以首先要为你的用户设计好你的产品，然后才去考虑如何利用它赚钱。如果你不把用户放在首位，那你的竞争对手将会有机可趁。



你必须了解用户心理，才能创造出他们喜欢的产品。你的公司越大，这件事就越困难。所以我说“慢慢成长”，你花钱花得越慢，你就有越多的时间去研究客户。



另一个节省开支的用意是形成一种勤俭的文化。这是Yahoo也很擅长的一件事。Yahoo的总裁David Filo，却对自己私底下的称号“吝啬鬼”很自豪。我们一到Yahoo就收到了他的Email，他浏览了我们的工作目录之后，询问我们是否真的需要把那么多个人资料存储在公司昂贵的RAID硬盘里。我对此印象深刻，Yahoo作为一家市值十亿级的公司，仍然能够注意硬盘中每一个字节的浪费。



当你从风投哪里弄到几百万美元之后，你可能会感到自己已经挺有钱了。你要搞清楚这只是一种幻觉，那些有丰厚利润的公司才是有钱的公司。资本并不代表利润，那只是投资人希望你用来获取利润的道具。所以除了银行里公司帐户那几百万，你们基本上还是一个穷公司。



创业初期的公司形象，应该是一个刚毕业的大学生，而不是一家律所。以酷和廉价代替昂贵和震撼的视觉效果。我们可以从一家创业公司是否使用Aeron chairs来判断他们是否明白这个道理。在网络泡沫时代，Aeron chairs在创业者中很流行。尤其是当那些公司都使用同样的型号的时候，场面就像一群用风投的钱玩过家家的小朋友。我们公司使用的椅子连扶手都没有，当年看上去有点寒碜，但回头想想，这也是我们在不知情的情况下就作对的重要事情之一。



我们公司处于Harvard Square的一幢木制三层楼中。1970年之前这里是一间公寓，浴室里还有有爪足浴缸的存在。这房子墙壁上用铝箔填充来阻挡宇宙射线的裂缝，代表着它曾经有过某个思路很特别的主人。当某些大人物来访问我们的办公室的时候，我们对于这幢房子的层次确实深感汗颜。不过事实上这里是一个很适合创业公司的地方，我们的角色不是那些平庸的制服组，而是虽然弱小，却勇于开创突破的幼兽。这正是创业者该有的心态。



一幢老式公寓同时也是软件开发的好场所。如果你尝试一下，你会发现分割成立方体的空间很合适编写软件的状态。有没有发现黑客们在家里的小空间比在办公室里工作显得轻松自在得多？那你为何不把办公室弄得像家一样呢。



当你选择创业公司的地点时，不要仅仅挑选那些会让你们看上去比较专业的地方。专业这个词代表优秀的工作成果，而不是电梯和玻璃墙。我建议创业者们尽量避免驻扎在专业办公楼，租一个公寓就好。创业的时候，你会经常想要索性住在办公室里，那何不就弄个可以住的办公室呢。



除了更便宜且便于工作，公寓往往还比办公楼位于更好的地段，在创业中这是很重要的。生产力的关键在于晚饭后的加班。这没有电话铃声骚扰的几个小时是工作出成果的最好时机。当你的员工成群结队地处去吃饭，在餐桌上讨论问题，然后回来解决它们的时候，你们的产品会发生了不起的进化。一旦你的公司进入那种所有人一下班就开个车回郊区的家里吃晚饭的境界，某些特别重要的理念基本上就不复存在了。如果你一开始创业就进入这样的阶段，那你只能求神保佑了。



今天如果我要再次创业，我只会考虑以下三个地点。on the Red Line near Central, Harvard, or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University or California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of campus. 这些我所知仅有的有创业成功希望的地方。



节省开支最重要的方法就是雇佣尽量少的员工。我可能有点极端，但我还是觉得雇佣新员工是一个公司所能做的最烂的事。在创业阶段，人工成本是巨大而令人最为讨厌的经常性开支。雇佣更多的人往往意味着过度的发展，甚至必须搬到一些不适合软件开发工作的地方。而最大的问题是，雇佣更多的人会让你的工作效率降低：以前只要把头伸进某个办公室三言两语解决的问题，现在要找齐八个人一起开个大会。所以你应该雇佣尽可能少的员工。



在网络泡沫时代很多创业公司采用了相反的方法，他们就想着尽快把自己做大，好像没有相关头衔的一个大部门你就没法做任何事情似的。大公司才可以这样做事情。不要雇佣人来填满你未来的组织结构图，雇佣新人的唯一理由是你有些想要做的工作没人能够完成。



既然雇佣不必要的员工又昂贵又没有效率，为什么几乎每个公司都这么干呢？我认为主要是因为人们喜欢有很多人为自己工作的感觉。这是一种劣根性，尤其体现在CEO身上。如果你曾经掌握一家公司，你会发现人们问的最多的问题是你有多少雇员，这是别人判断你的身价的一种方式。不仅仅是一般交往中人们会问，那些写新闻的也会注重这一点。而且他们对于上千人的公司会刮目相看，而10个人的就不屑一顾。



这太荒唐了，如果两家有相同收益的公司，员工数量较少的那家明显经营得更好。当别人问我我创业时有多少员工，我总是回答“20个”，而他们就会摆出那种明显不以为然的表情。我曾经想过加上这么一句“不过我们的主要竞争对手，那个有140个雇员的家伙，一直被我们打得落花流水。要不然我们用这两个数字间比较大的那个来申请贷款你看如何？”



考虑到办公室空间，你的员工数量最好保持在看上去紧凑和真的拥挤之间。任何一个读过大学的聪明人都会明白这个道理。当你创业的时候，别忘了保持这个员工数量。



你有决心么？



问自己以下问题。我应该创业么？我行么？值得冒这个险么？



绝大部分人比他们自己所一直以为的更适合创业这件事，这是我写这篇文章的主要原因。世界上其实有比现在创业的人数更多10倍的潜在创业者，如果他们都进入市场，一切会变得更美好。



我现在才意识到，当时我的确已经是一个很适合创业的人，虽然这个想法曾经让我感到恐惧。作为一个LISP流的黑客，我是被迫创业的，因为我原先打工的咨询公司出了麻烦，而市场上又没有多少使用LISP的公司。因为我实在不能容忍用另一种程序语言写代码（在1995年，所谓另一种语言就是C++），我不的不考虑自己创立一家使用LISP写程序的公司。



我知道这听上去有点不可思议，但如果你也是一个LISP流的黑客你就会明白我的意思了。我在只有创业这一条路的时候才选择开设自己的公司，仅仅因为这件事情本身在当时的我看来太过于困难了。有鉴于此，世上肯定还有很多适合创业的人却因为被这件事困难的外表吓阻而没有这么做。



那么谁应该自己创业呢？一个23到38岁之间，想要一口气解决财政问题而不是在打工的地方无聊地消磨时光的黑客。



我不能给出一个优秀的黑客的定义。在一家一流大学里这个词可能可以指计算机专业排名前50%的学员。但其实你不需要在大学里学计算机就可以做一个黑客，比如我在大学里学的是哲学。



在你还年轻的时候，想要搞明白自己是不是真正优秀的黑客是很困难的。幸运的是，创业的过程会自动地对你们的水平做筛选。技术人员创业的动力在于，或者应该在于以挑剔的眼光看待现存的某项技术，并且发现他们的各种缺点和解决的方法。同时这也是一个优秀黑客所应该具有的特征。



我把创业的下限定于23岁是因为在创业之前，你需要自己看一下别人如何经营他们的公司，而不是因为你的头脑如何如何不成熟。你的学习对象并不一定要选择创业公司。我用了一年时间为一家软件公司工作以偿还我的助学贷款，而这真是我成人后最糟糕的一年。不过虽然当时还没意识到，我确实在那里学到了软件生意中一些很重要的知识。某种意义上来说，那家公司完全是反面典型：没有会议；没有多人掌握的核心代码；没有专门负责销售和运营的人员；不做高端产品；不让人写太长的代码；不理会售后人员对于程序bug的意见；不做最大努力就放弃；不从客户那里吸取教训；不把办公室从Cambridge搬到Route128，等等等等。不过反面教材和正面教材一样有效，甚至更有效。因为灵光一现的创意是很难复制的，但是避免错误却总是可能的。



另一个23岁之前很难创业的理由，是人们不会把太年轻的你当一回事。风投不会相信你的能力，他们只把你当成一个骗取投资的小丑。客户们担心你的信誉，害怕你会突然撒手不管。正常情况下，就连你自己在某些方面都会怀疑自己。雇佣一个比你年长的人是很尴尬的，而21岁就当老板的你可能只想选择21岁以下的家伙，这样当然会更难发现人才。



有些猛人乐于在18岁就开始创业。当比尔盖茨和保罗艾伦一起创办微软的时候，他才19岁。（Paul是22岁，所以这件事情可能不是我们所以为的那样特别。）如果你觉得，无论别人说什么，你都必须立刻开始创业，那就尝试去做吧。



另一头，我选择38岁作为创业的底线，是有很多理由的。首先是因为我觉得自己做老板所需要的体力巨大，很难想象一个将近40的人还能支持住。那时候我能够坚持每天工作到凌晨两三点，而现在我很怀疑自己的体力能不能做到。



另一方面，创业是件冒险的事情。如果你尝试去做，结果在26岁的时候破产了，那还好，许多创业者大约26岁时都破产过。不过38岁的时候，你大概就很难承受这种危险了——尤其是为了你的孩子考虑，如果你有的话。



最后一个问题可能相当沉重。你确定你真的想要自己创业么？从经济角度来考虑，你的职业生涯可能从此走到一条独木桥上。你不再有安稳地工作40年的权力了，取而代之的可能是像地狱一样艰苦的四年。甚至你还可能破产——这件事倒是不需要四年那么久。



在创业的时候，你可能几乎没有时间做工作以外的事情。因为即使在你休息的时候，你的竞争者们也在前进。我唯一的娱乐活动是跑步，因为这是我保持健康的唯一手段，另加上15分钟的睡前阅读。3年中我只有两个月的时候有一个女朋友，而每两星期我去一次二手书店或者去朋友家吃一次晚饭，每星期回父母那里一次。其它时间，全都在工作上了。



鉴于我的合作伙伴都是我的好朋友，工作还算是有趣。在10%的时间里它甚至相当让人喜爱。对于另90%的时间，我能说的只是，事后回头看看它们，还挺有意思的。比如Cambridge断电的6小时，还有我们灾难性的在办公室里使用汽油发电机的尝试，不过我可不想再经历一次。



我并不认为创业的过程会比你的打工生涯发生更多的恶心事件。其实我想总数还要少一点，但是因为它们都挤在一段短短的时间内，所以看上去特别多。所以说，创业给你的最大回报就是时间。如果你在考虑开始做，首先想想你对自由的时间的感觉。如果你是那种不愿意勤恳工作40年，而是希望一次性地解决经济问题的人，那你应该选择创业。



很多人需要在创业和学业之间做出选择。大学生正处于合适的年纪，并且也正是软件业合适的创业人选。你可能会担心开公司会打乱你的学习计划而失去进一步深造的机会。不过在学校里就可以创业，在创业初期边读书边搞公司其实是很简单的。我们的三个创始人中有两个全天在学校里，并且都拿到了文凭。几乎没有什么比一个延期毕业的学生更有冲劲的人了。



如果因为创业你必须离开学校，好歹这种痛苦不会持续太长时间。如果创业是失败的，一般它都会在你失去回到学校的机会之前就结束。如果它成功了，你就不再留恋无聊的助教生涯了。



如果你真的想创业，尽管去做吧。开公司并不是什么难事，你不需要理解什么“做生意的奥秘”之类的玩意。创造一些人们会喜欢使用的东西，然后尽量节省开支保证有钱赚，仅此而已。不是很简单么？


=======================================

How To Start A StartUp

March 2005

(This essay is derived from a talk at the Harvard Computer Society.)

You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible. Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed.

And that's kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all three are doable. Hard, but doable. And since a startup that succeeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting rich is doable too. Hard, but doable.

If there is one message I'd like to get across about startups, that's it. There is no magically difficult step that requires brilliance to solve.

The Idea

In particular, you don't need a brilliant idea to start a startup around. The way a startup makes money is to offer people better technology than they have now. But what people have now is often so bad that it doesn't take brilliance to do better.

Google's plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that didn't suck. They had three new ideas: index more of the Web, use links to rank search results, and have clean, simple web pages with unintrusive keyword-based ads. Above all, they were determined to make a site that was good to use. No doubt there are great technical tricks within Google, but the overall plan was straightforward. And while they probably have bigger ambitions now, this alone brings them a billion dollars a year. [1]

There are plenty of other areas that are just as backward as search was before Google. I can think of several heuristics for generating ideas for startups, but most reduce to this: look at something people are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that doesn't suck.

For example, dating sites currently suck far worse than search did before Google. They all use the same simple-minded model. They seem to have approached the problem by thinking about how to do database matches instead of how dating works in the real world. An undergrad could build something better as a class project. And yet there's a lot of money at stake. Online dating is a valuable business now, and it might be worth a hundred times as much if it worked.

An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning. A lot of would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is the initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute. Venture capitalists know better. If you go to VC firms with a brilliant idea that you'll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosure agreement, most will tell you to get lost. That shows how much a mere idea is worth. The market price is less than the inconvenience of signing an NDA.

Another sign of how little the initial idea is worth is the number of startups that change their plan en route. Microsoft's original plan was to make money selling programming languages, of all things. Their current business model didn't occur to them until IBM dropped it in their lap five years later.

Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble is, they're not transferrable. They're not something you could hand to someone else to execute. Their value is mainly as starting points: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinking about.

What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them. Good people can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can't save bad people.

People

What do I mean by good people? One of the best tricks I learned during our startup was a rule for deciding who to hire. Could you describe the person as an animal? It might be hard to translate that into another language, but I think everyone in the US knows what it means. It means someone who takes their work a little too seriously; someone who does what they do so well that they pass right through professional and cross over into obsessive.

What it means specifically depends on the job: a salesperson who just won't take no for an answer; a hacker who will stay up till 4:00 AM rather than go to bed leaving code with a bug in it; a PR person who will cold-call New York Times reporters on their cell phones; a graphic designer who feels physical pain when something is two millimeters out of place.

Almost everyone who worked for us was an animal at what they did. The woman in charge of sales was so tenacious that I used to feel sorry for potential customers on the phone with her. You could sense them squirming on the hook, but you knew there would be no rest for them till they'd signed up.

If you think about people you know, you'll find the animal test is easy to apply. Call the person's image to mind and imagine the sentence "so-and-so is an animal." If you laugh, they're not. You don't need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, but you need it in a startup.

For programmers we had three additional tests. Was the person genuinely smart? If so, could they actually get things done? And finally, since a few good hackers have unbearable personalities, could we stand to have them around?

That last test filters out surprisingly few people. We could bear any amount of nerdiness if someone was truly smart. What we couldn't stand were people with a lot of attitude. But most of those weren't truly smart, so our third test was largely a restatement of the first.

When nerds are unbearable it's usually because they're trying too hard to seem smart. But the smarter they are, the less pressure they feel to act smart. So as a rule you can recognize genuinely smart people by their ability to say things like "I don't know," "Maybe you're right," and "I don't understand x well enough."

This technique doesn't always work, because people can be influenced by their environment. In the MIT CS department, there seems to be a tradition of acting like a brusque know-it-all. I'm told it derives ultimately from Marvin Minsky, in the same way the classic airline pilot manner is said to derive from Chuck Yeager. Even genuinely smart people start to act this way there, so you have to make allowances.

It helped us to have Robert Morris, who is one of the readiest to say "I don't know" of anyone I've met. (At least, he was before he became a professor at MIT.) No one dared put on attitude around Robert, because he was obviously smarter than they were and yet had zero attitude himself.

Like most startups, ours began with a group of friends, and it was through personal contacts that we got most of the people we hired. This is a crucial difference between startups and big companies. Being friends with someone for even a couple days will tell you more than companies could ever learn in interviews. [2]

It's no coincidence that startups start around universities, because that's where smart people meet. It's not what people learn in classes at MIT and Stanford that has made technology companies spring up around them. They could sing campfire songs in the classes so long as admissions worked the same.

If you start a startup, there's a good chance it will be with people you know from college or grad school. So in theory you ought to try to make friends with as many smart people as you can in school, right? Well, no. Don't make a conscious effort to schmooze; that doesn't work well with hackers.

What you should do in college is work on your own projects. Hackers should do this even if they don't plan to start startups, because it's the only real way to learn how to program. In some cases you may collaborate with other students, and this is the best way to get to know good hackers. The project may even grow into a startup. But once again, I wouldn't aim too directly at either target. Don't force things; just work on stuff you like with people you like.

Ideally you want between two and four founders. It would be hard to start with just one. One person would find the moral weight of starting a company hard to bear. Even Bill Gates, who seems to be able to bear a good deal of moral weight, had to have a co-founder. But you don't want so many founders that the company starts to look like a group photo. Partly because you don't need a lot of people at first, but mainly because the more founders you have, the worse disagreements you'll have. When there are just two or three founders, you know you have to resolve disputes immediately or perish. If there are seven or eight, disagreements can linger and harden into factions. You don't want mere voting; you need unanimity.

In a technology startup, which most startups are, the founders should include technical people. During the Internet Bubble there were a number of startups founded by business people who then went looking for hackers to create their product for them. This doesn't work well. Business people are bad at deciding what to do with technology, because they don't know what the options are, or which kinds of problems are hard and which are easy. And when business people try to hire hackers, they can't tell which ones are good. Even other hackers have a hard time doing that. For business people it's roulette.

Do the founders of a startup have to include business people? That depends. We thought so when we started ours, and we asked several people who were said to know about this mysterious thing called "business" if they would be the president. But they all said no, so I had to do it myself. And what I discovered was that business was no great mystery. It's not something like physics or medicine that requires extensive study. You just try to get people to pay you for stuff.

I think the reason I made such a mystery of business was that I was disgusted by the idea of doing it. I wanted to work in the pure, intellectual world of software, not deal with customers' mundane problems. People who don't want to get dragged into some kind of work often develop a protective incompetence at it. Paul Erdos was particularly good at this. By seeming unable even to cut a grapefruit in half (let alone go to the store and buy one), he forced other people to do such things for him, leaving all his time free for math. Erdos was an extreme case, but most husbands use the same trick to some degree.

Once I was forced to discard my protective incompetence, I found that business was neither so hard nor so boring as I feared. There are esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax law or the pricing of derivatives, but you don't need to know about those in a startup. All you need to know about business to run a startup are commonsense things people knew before there were business schools, or even universities.

If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the name of each person with an MBA, you'll learn something important about business school. After Warren Buffett, you don't hit another MBA till number 22, Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike. There are only 5 MBAs in the top 50. What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with technical backgrounds. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore. The rulers of the technology business tend to come from technology, not business. So if you want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed in business, the evidence suggests you'd do better to learn how to hack than get an MBA. [3]

There is one reason you might want to include business people in a startup, though: because you have to have at least one person willing and able to focus on what customers want. Some believe only business people can do this-- that hackers can implement software, but not design it. That's nonsense. There's nothing about knowing how to program that prevents hackers from understanding users, or about not knowing how to program that magically enables business people to understand them.

If you can't understand users, however, you should either learn how or find a co-founder who can. That is the single most important issue for technology startups, and the rock that sinks more of them than anything else.

What Customers Want

It's not just startups that have to worry about this. I think most businesses that fail do it because they don't give customers what they want. Look at restaurants. A large percentage fail, about a quarter in the first year. But can you think of one restaurant that had really good food and went out of business?

Restaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what. A restaurant with great food can be expensive, crowded, noisy, dingy, out of the way, and even have bad service, and people will keep coming. It's true that a restaurant with mediocre food can sometimes attract customers through gimmicks. But that approach is very risky. It's more straightforward just to make the food good.

It's the same with technology. You hear all kinds of reasons why startups fail. But can you think of one that had a massively popular product and still failed?

In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers didn't want the product. For most, the cause of death is listed as "ran out of funding," but that's only the immediate cause. Why couldn't they get more funding? Probably because the product was a dog, or never seemed likely to be done, or both.

When I was trying to think of the things every startup needed to do, I almost included a fourth: get a version 1 out as soon as you can. But I decided not to, because that's implicit in making something customers want. The only way to make something customers want is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on their reactions.

The other approach is what I call the "Hail Mary" strategy. You make elaborate plans for a product, hire a team of engineers to develop it (people who do this tend to use the term "engineer" for hackers), and then find after a year that you've spent two million dollars to develop something no one wants. This was not uncommon during the Bubble, especially in companies run by business types, who thought of software development as something terrifying that therefore had to be carefully planned.

We never even considered that approach. As a Lisp hacker, I come from the tradition of rapid prototyping. I would not claim (at least, not here) that this is the right way to write every program, but it's certainly the right way to write software for a startup. In a startup, your initial plans are almost certain to be wrong in some way, and your first priority should be to figure out where. The only way to do that is to try implementing them.

Like most startups, we changed our plan on the fly. At first we expected our customers to be Web consultants. But it turned out they didn't like us, because our software was easy to use and we hosted the site. It would be too easy for clients to fire them. We also thought we'd be able to sign up a lot of catalog companies, because selling online was a natural extension of their existing business. But in 1996 that was a hard sell. The middle managers we talked to at catalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but as something that meant more work for them.

We did get a few of the more adventurous catalog companies. Among them was Frederick's of Hollywood, which gave us valuable experience dealing with heavy loads on our servers. But most of our users were small, individual merchants who saw the Web as an opportunity to build a business. Some had retail stores, but many only existed online. And so we changed direction to focus on these users. Instead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalog companies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.

I learned something valuable from that. It's worth trying very, very hard to make technology easy to use. Hackers are so used to computers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to normal people. Stephen Hawking's editor told him that every equation he included in his book would cut sales in half. When you work on making technology easier to use, you're riding that curve up instead of down. A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn't just increase your sales 10%. It's more likely to double your sales.

How do you figure out what customers want? Watch them. One of the best places to do this was at trade shows. Trade shows didn't pay as a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as market research. We didn't just give canned presentations at trade shows. We used to show people how to build real, working stores. Which meant we got to watch as they used our software, and talk to them about what they needed.

No matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a stretch for you, the founders, to understand what users want. The only kind of software you can build without studying users is the sort for which you are the typical user. But this is just the kind that tends to be open source: operating systems, programming languages, editors, and so on. So if you're developing technology for money, you're probably not going to be developing it for people like you. Indeed, you can use this as a way to generate ideas for startups: what do people who are not like you want from technology?

When most people think of startups, they think of companies like Apple or Google. Everyone knows these, because they're big consumer brands. But for every startup like that, there are twenty more that operate in niche markets or live quietly down in the infrastructure. So if you start a successful startup, odds are you'll start one of those.

Another way to say that is, if you try to start the kind of startup that has to be a big consumer brand, the odds against succeeding are steeper. The best odds are in niche markets. Since startups make money by offering people something better than they had before, the best opportunities are where things suck most. And it would be hard to find a place where things suck more than in corporate IT departments. You would not believe the amount of money companies spend on software, and the crap they get in return. This imbalance equals opportunity.

If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a couple weeks just watching what they do with computers. Most good hackers have no more idea of the horrors perpetrated in these places than rich Americans do of what goes on in Brazilian slums.

Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it's easier to sell to them. It's worth so much to sell stuff to big companies that the people selling them the crap they currently use spend a lot of time and money to do it. And while you can outhack Oracle with one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can't outsell an Oracle salesman. So if you want to win through better technology, aim at smaller customers. [4]

They're the more strategically valuable part of the market anyway. In technology, the low end always eats the high end. It's easier to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful product cheaper. So the products that start as cheap, simple options tend to gradually grow more powerful till, like water rising in a room, they squash the "high-end" products against the ceiling. Sun did this to mainframes, and Intel is doing it to Sun. Microsoft Word did it to desktop publishing software like Interleaf and Framemaker. Mass-market digital cameras are doing it to the expensive models made for professionals. Avid did it to the manufacturers of specialized video editing systems, and now Apple is doing it to Avid. Henry Ford did it to the car makers that preceded him. If you build the simple, inexpensive option, you'll not only find it easier to sell at first, but you'll also be in the best position to conquer the rest of the market.

It's very dangerous to let anyone fly under you. If you have the cheapest, easiest product, you'll own the low end. And if you don't, you're in the crosshairs of whoever does.

Raising Money

To make all this happen, you're going to need money. Some startups have been self-funding-- Microsoft for example-- but most aren't. I think it's wise to take money from investors. To be self-funding, you have to start as a consulting company, and it's hard to switch from that to a product company.

Financially, a startup is like a pass/fail course. The way to get rich from a startup is to maximize the company's chances of succeeding, not to maximize the amount of stock you retain. So if you can trade stock for something that improves your odds, it's probably a smart move.

To most hackers, getting investors seems like a terrifying and mysterious process. Actually it's merely tedious. I'll try to give an outline of how it works.

The first thing you'll need is a few tens of thousands of dollars to pay your expenses while you develop a prototype. This is called seed capital. Because so little money is involved, raising seed capital is comparatively easy-- at least in the sense of getting a quick yes or no.

Usually you get seed money from individual rich people called "angels." Often they're people who themselves got rich from technology. At the seed stage, investors don't expect you to have an elaborate business plan. Most know that they're supposed to decide quickly. It's not unusual to get a check within a week based on a half-page agreement.

We started Viaweb with $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian. But he gave us a lot more than money. He's a former CEO and also a corporate lawyer, so he gave us a lot of valuable advice about business, and also did all the legal work of getting us set up as a company. Plus he introduced us to one of the two angel investors who supplied our next round of funding.

Some angels, especially those with technology backgrounds, may be satisfied with a demo and a verbal description of what you plan to do. But many will want a copy of your business plan, if only to remind themselves what they invested in.

Our angels asked for one, and looking back, I'm amazed how much worry it caused me. "Business plan" has that word "business" in it, so I figured it had to be something I'd have to read a book about business plans to write. Well, it doesn't. At this stage, all most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan to do and how you're going to make money from it, and the resumes of the founders. If you just sit down and write out what you've been saying to one another, that should be fine. It shouldn't take more than a couple hours, and you'll probably find that writing it all down gives you more ideas about what to do.

For the angel to have someone to make the check out to, you're going to have to have some kind of company. Merely incorporating yourselves isn't hard. The problem is, for the company to exist, you have to decide who the founders are, and how much stock they each have. If there are two founders with the same qualifications who are both equally committed to the business, that's easy. But if you have a number of people who are expected to contribute in varying degrees, arranging the proportions of stock can be hard. And once you've done it, it tends to be set in stone.

I have no tricks for dealing with this problem. All I can say is, try hard to do it right. I do have a rule of thumb for recognizing when you have, though. When everyone feels they're getting a slightly bad deal, that they're doing more than they should for the amount of stock they have, the stock is optimally apportioned.

There is more to setting up a company than incorporating it, of course: insurance, business license, unemployment compensation, various things with the IRS. I'm not even sure what the list is, because we, ah, skipped all that. When we got real funding near the end of 1996, we hired a great CFO, who fixed everything retroactively. It turns out that no one comes and arrests you if you don't do everything you're supposed to when starting a company. And a good thing too, or a lot of startups would never get started. [5]

It can be dangerous to delay turning yourself into a company, because one or more of the founders might decide to split off and start another company doing the same thing. This does happen. So when you set up the company, as well as as apportioning the stock, you should get all the founders to sign something agreeing that everyone's ideas belong to this company, and that this company is going to be everyone's only job.

[If this were a movie, ominous music would begin here.]

While you're at it, you should ask what else they've signed. One of the worst things that can happen to a startup is to run into intellectual property problems. We did, and it came closer to killing us than any competitor ever did.

As we were in the middle of getting bought, we discovered that one of our people had, early on, been bound by an agreement that said all his ideas belonged to the giant company that was paying for him to go to grad school. In theory, that could have meant someone else owned big chunks of our software. So the acquisition came to a screeching halt while we tried to sort this out. The problem was, since we'd been about to be acquired, we'd allowed ourselves to run low on cash. Now we needed to raise more to keep going. But it's hard to raise money with an IP cloud over your head, because investors can't judge how serious it is.

Our existing investors, knowing that we needed money and had nowhere else to get it, at this point attempted certain gambits which I will not describe in detail, except to remind readers that the word "angel" is a metaphor. The founders thereupon proposed to walk away from the company, after giving the investors a brief tutorial on how to administer the servers themselves. And while this was happening, the acquirers used the delay as an excuse to welch on the deal.

Miraculously it all turned out ok. The investors backed down; we did another round of funding at a reasonable valuation; the giant company finally gave us a piece of paper saying they didn't own our software; and six months later we were bought by Yahoo for much more than the earlier acquirer had agreed to pay. So we were happy in the end, though the experience probably took several years off my life.

Don't do what we did. Before you consummate a startup, ask everyone about their previous IP history.

Once you've got a company set up, it may seem presumptuous to go knocking on the doors of rich people and asking them to invest tens of thousands of dollars in something that is really just a bunch of guys with some ideas. But when you look at it from the rich people's point of view, the picture is more encouraging. Most rich people are looking for good investments. If you really think you have a chance of succeeding, you're doing them a favor by letting them invest. Mixed with any annoyance they might feel about being approached will be the thought: are these guys the next Google?

Usually angels are financially equivalent to founders. They get the same kind of stock and get diluted the same amount in future rounds. How much stock should they get? That depends on how ambitious you feel. When you offer x percent of your company for y dollars, you're implicitly claiming a certain value for the whole company. Venture investments are usually described in terms of that number. If you give an investor new shares equal to 5% of those already outstanding in return for $100,000, then you've done the deal at a pre-money valuation of $2 million.

How do you decide what the value of the company should be? There is no rational way. At this stage the company is just a bet. I didn't realize that when we were raising money. Julian thought we ought to value the company at several million dollars. I thought it was preposterous to claim that a couple thousand lines of code, which was all we had at the time, were worth several million dollars. Eventually we settled on one millon, because Julian said no one would invest in a company with a valuation any lower. [6]

What I didn't grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn't just the value of the code we'd written so far. It was also the value of our ideas, which turned out to be right, and of all the future work we'd do, which turned out to be a lot.

The next round of funding is the one in which you might deal with actual venture capital firms. But don't wait till you've burned through your last round of funding to start approaching them. VCs are slow to make up their minds. They can take months. You don't want to be running out of money while you're trying to negotiate with them.

Getting money from an actual VC firm is a bigger deal than getting money from angels. The amounts of money involved are larger, millions usually. So the deals take longer, dilute you more, and impose more onerous conditions.

Sometimes the VCs want to install a new CEO of their own choosing. Usually the claim is that you need someone mature and experienced, with a business background. Maybe in some cases this is true. And yet Bill Gates was young and inexperienced and had no business background, and he seems to have done ok. Steve Jobs got booted out of his own company by someone mature and experienced, with a business background, who then proceeded to ruin the company. So I think people who are mature and experienced, with a business background, may be overrated. We used to call these guys "newscasters," because they had neat hair and spoke in deep, confident voices, and generally didn't know much more than they read on the teleprompter.

We talked to a number of VCs, but eventually we ended up financing our startup entirely with angel money. The main reason was that we feared a brand-name VC firm would stick us with a newscaster as part of the deal. That might have been ok if he was content to limit himself to talking to the press, but what if he wanted to have a say in running the company? That would have led to disaster, because our software was so complex. We were a company whose whole m.o. was to win through better technology. The strategic decisions were mostly decisions about technology, and we didn't need any help with those.

This was also one reason we didn't go public. Back in 1998 our CFO tried to talk me into it. In those days you could go public as a dogfood portal, so as a company with a real product and real revenues, we might have done well. But I feared it would have meant taking on a newscaster-- someone who, as they say, "can talk Wall Street's language."

I'm happy to see Google is bucking that trend. They didn't talk Wall Street's language when they did their IPO, and Wall Street didn't buy. And now Wall Street is collectively kicking itself. They'll pay attention next time. Wall Street learns new languages fast when money is involved.

You have more leverage negotiating with VCs than you realize. The reason is other VCs. I know a number of VCs now, and when you talk to them you realize that it's a seller's market. Even now there is too much money chasing too few good deals.

VCs form a pyramid. At the top are famous ones like Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins, but beneath those are a huge number you've never heard of. What they all have in common is that a dollar from them is worth one dollar. Most VCs will tell you that they don't just provide money, but connections and advice. If you're talking to Vinod Khosla or John Doerr or Mike Moritz, this is true. But such advice and connections can come very expensive. And as you go down the food chain the VCs get rapidly dumber. A few steps down from the top you're basically talking to bankers who've picked up a few new vocabulary words from reading Wired. (Does your product use XML?) So I'd advise you to be skeptical about claims of experience and connections. Basically, a VC is a source of money. I'd be inclined to go with whoever offered the most money the soonest with the least strings attached.

You may wonder how much to tell VCs. And you should, because some of them may one day be funding your competitors. I think the best plan is not to be overtly secretive, but not to tell them everything either. After all, as most VCs say, they're more interested in the people than the ideas. The main reason they want to talk about your idea is to judge you, not the idea. So as long as you seem like you know what you're doing, you can probably keep a few things back from them. [7]

Talk to as many VCs as you can, even if you don't want their money, because a) they may be on the board of someone who will buy you, and b) if you seem impressive, they'll be discouraged from investing in your competitors. The most efficient way to reach VCs, especially if you only want them to know about you and don't want their money, is at the conferences that are occasionally organized for startups to present to them.

Not Spending It

When and if you get an infusion of real money from investors, what should you do with it? Not spend it, that's what. In nearly every startup that fails, the proximate cause is running out of money. Usually there is something deeper wrong. But even a proximate cause of death is worth trying hard to avoid.

During the Bubble many startups tried to "get big fast." Ideally this meant getting a lot of customers fast. But it was easy for the meaning to slide over into hiring a lot of people fast.

Of the two versions, the one where you get a lot of customers fast is of course preferable. But even that may be overrated. The idea is to get there first and get all the users, leaving none for competitors. But I think in most businesses the advantages of being first to market are not so overwhelmingly great. Google is again a case in point. When they appeared it seemed as if search was a mature market, dominated by big players who'd spent millions to build their brands: Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista, Inktomi. Surely 1998 was a little late to arrive at the party.

But as the founders of Google knew, brand is worth next to nothing in the search business. You can come along at any point and make something better, and users will gradually seep over to you. As if to emphasize the point, Google never did any advertising. They're like dealers; they sell the stuff, but they know better than to use it themselves.

The competitors Google buried would have done better to spend those millions improving their software. Future startups should learn from that mistake. Unless you're in a market where products are as undifferentiated as cigarettes or vodka or laundry detergent, spending a lot on brand advertising is a sign of breakage. And few if any Web businesses are so undifferentiated. The dating sites are running big ad campaigns right now, which is all the more evidence they're ripe for the picking. (Fee, fie, fo, fum, I smell a company run by marketing guys.)

We were compelled by circumstances to grow slowly, and in retrospect it was a good thing. The founders all learned to do every job in the company. As well as writing software, I had to do sales and customer support. At sales I was not very good. I was persistent, but I didn't have the smoothness of a good salesman. My message to potential customers was: you'd be stupid not to sell online, and if you sell online you'd be stupid to use anyone else's software. Both statements were true, but that's not the way to convince people.

I was great at customer support though. Imagine talking to a customer support person who not only knew everything about the product, but would apologize abjectly if there was a bug, and then fix it immediately, while you were on the phone with them. Customers loved us. And we loved them, because when you're growing slow by word of mouth, your first batch of users are the ones who were smart enough to find you by themselves. There is nothing more valuable, in the early stages of a startup, than smart users. If you listen to them, they'll tell you exactly how to make a winning product. And not only will they give you this advice for free, they'll pay you.

We officially launched in early 1996. By the end of that year we had about 70 users. Since this was the era of "get big fast," I worried about how small and obscure we were. But in fact we were doing exactly the right thing. Once you get big (in users or employees) it gets hard to change your product. That year was effectively a laboratory for improving our software. By the end of it, we were so far ahead of our competitors that they never had a hope of catching up. And since all the hackers had spent many hours talking to users, we understood online commerce way better than anyone else.

That's the key to success as a startup. There is nothing more important than understanding your business. You might think that anyone in a business must, ex officio, understand it. Far from it. Google's secret weapon was simply that they understood search. I was working for Yahoo when Google appeared, and Yahoo didn't understand search. I know because I once tried to convince the powers that be that we had to make search better, and I got in reply what was then the party line about it: that Yahoo was no longer a mere "search engine." Search was now only a small percentage of our page views, less than one month's growth, and now that we were established as a "media company," or "portal," or whatever we were, search could safely be allowed to wither and drop off, like an umbilical cord.

Well, a small fraction of page views they may be, but they are an important fraction, because they are the page views that Web sessions start with. I think Yahoo gets that now.

Google understands a few other things most Web companies still don't. The most important is that you should put users before advertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users aren't. One of my favorite bumper stickers reads "if the people lead, the leaders will follow." Paraphrased for the Web, this becomes "get all the users, and the advertisers will follow." More generally, design your product to please users first, and then think about how to make money from it. If you don't put users first, you leave a gap for competitors who do.

To make something users love, you have to understand them. And the bigger you are, the harder that is. So I say "get big slow." The slower you burn through your funding, the more time you have to learn.

The other reason to spend money slowly is to encourage a culture of cheapness. That's something Yahoo did understand. David Filo's title was "Chief Yahoo," but he was proud that his unofficial title was "Cheap Yahoo." Soon after we arrived at Yahoo, we got an email from Filo, who had been crawling around our directory hierarchy, asking if it was really necessary to store so much of our data on expensive RAID drives. I was impressed by that. Yahoo's market cap then was already in the billions, and they were still worrying about wasting a few gigs of disk space.

When you get a couple million dollars from a VC firm, you tend to feel rich. It's important to realize you're not. A rich company is one with large revenues. This money isn't revenue. It's money investors have given you in the hope you'll be able to generate revenues. So despite those millions in the bank, you're still poor.

For most startups the model should be grad student, not law firm. Aim for cool and cheap, not expensive and impressive. For us the test of whether a startup understood this was whether they had Aeron chairs. The Aeron came out during the Bubble and was very popular with startups. Especially the type, all too common then, that was like a bunch of kids playing house with money supplied by VCs. We had office chairs so cheap that the arms all fell off. This was slightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studenty atmosphere of our office was another of those things we did right without knowing it.

Our offices were in a wooden triple-decker in Harvard Square. It had been an apartment until about the 1970s, and there was still a claw-footed bathtub in the bathroom. It must once have been inhabited by someone fairly eccentric, because a lot of the chinks in the walls were stuffed with aluminum foil, as if to protect against cosmic rays. When eminent visitors came to see us, we were a bit sheepish about the low production values. But in fact that place was the perfect space for a startup. We felt like our role was to be impudent underdogs instead of corporate stuffed shirts, and that is exactly the spirit you want.

An apartment is also the right kind of place for developing software. Cube farms suck for that, as you've probably discovered if you've tried it. Ever notice how much easier it is to hack at home than at work? So why not make work more like home?

When you're looking for space for a startup, don't feel that it has to look professional. Professional means doing good work, not elevators and glass walls. I'd advise most startups to avoid corporate space at first and just rent an apartment. You want to live at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designed to be lived in as your office?

Besides being cheaper and better to work in, apartments tend to be in better locations than office buildings. And for a startup location is very important. The key to productivity is for people to come back to work after dinner. Those hours after the phone stops ringing are by far the best for getting work done. Great things happen when a group of employees go out to dinner together, talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement them. So you want to be in a place where there are a lot of restaurants around, not some dreary office park that's a wasteland after 6:00 PM. Once a company shifts over into the model where everyone drives home to the suburbs for dinner, however late, you've lost something extraordinarily valuable. God help you if you actually start in that mode.

If I were going to start a startup today, there are only three places I'd consider doing it: on the Red Line near Central, Harvard, or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University or California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of campus. These are the only places I know that have the right kind of vibe.

The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people. I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing a company can do. To start with, people are a recurring expense, which is the worst kind. They also tend to cause you to grow out of your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office building that will make your software worse. But worst of all, they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone's office and checking out an idea with them, eight people have to have a meeting about it. So the fewer people you can hire, the better.

During the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy. They wanted to get "staffed up" as soon as possible, as if you couldn't get anything done unless there was someone with the corresponding job title. That's big company thinking. Don't hire people to fill the gaps in some a priori org chart. The only reason to hire someone is to do something you'd like to do but can't.

If hiring unnecessary people is expensive and slows you down, why do nearly all companies do it? I think the main reason is that people like the idea of having a lot of people working for them. This weakness often extends right up to the CEO. If you ever end up running a company, you'll find the most common question people ask is how many employees you have. This is their way of weighing you. It's not just random people who ask this; even reporters do. And they're going to be a lot more impressed if the answer is a thousand than if it's ten.

This is ridiculous, really. If two companies have the same revenues, it's the one with fewer employees that's more impressive. When people used to ask me how many people our startup had, and I answered "twenty," I could see them thinking that we didn't count for much. I used to want to add "but our main competitor, whose ass we regularly kick, has a hundred and forty, so can we have credit for the larger of the two numbers?"

As with office space, the number of your employees is a choice between seeming impressive, and being impressive. Any of you who were nerds in high school know about this choice. Keep doing it when you start a company.

Should You?

But should you start a company? Are you the right sort of person to do it? If you are, is it worth it?

More people are the right sort of person to start a startup than realize it. That's the main reason I wrote this. There could be ten times more startups than there are, and that would probably be a good thing.

I was, I now realize, exactly the right sort of person to start a startup. But the idea terrified me at first. I was forced into it because I was a Lisp hacker. The company I'd been consulting for seemed to be running into trouble, and there were not a lot of other companies using Lisp. Since I couldn't bear the thought of programming in another language (this was 1995, remember, when "another language" meant C++) the only option seemed to be to start a new company using Lisp.

I realize this sounds far-fetched, but if you're a Lisp hacker you'll know what I mean. And if the idea of starting a startup frightened me so much that I only did it out of necessity, there must be a lot of people who would be good at it but who are too intimidated to try.

So who should start a startup? Someone who is a good hacker, between about 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one shot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working life.

I can't say precisely what a good hacker is. At a first rate university this might include the top half of computer science majors. Though of course you don't have to be a CS major to be a hacker; I was a philosophy major in college.

It's hard to tell whether you're a good hacker, especially when you're young. Fortunately the process of starting startups tends to select them automatically. What drives people to start startups is (or should be) looking at existing technology and thinking, don't these guys realize they should be doing x, y, and z? And that's also a sign that one is a good hacker.

I put the lower bound at 23 not because there's something that doesn't happen to your brain till then, but because you need to see what it's like in an existing business before you try running your own. The business doesn't have to be a startup. I spent a year working for a software company to pay off my college loans. It was the worst year of my adult life, but I learned, without realizing it at the time, a lot of valuable lessons about the software business. In this case they were mostly negative lessons: don't have a lot of meetings; don't have chunks of code that multiple people own; don't have a sales guy running the company; don't make a high-end product; don't let your code get too big; don't leave finding bugs to QA people; don't go too long between releases; don't isolate developers from users; don't move from Cambridge to Route 128; and so on. [8] But negative lessons are just as valuable as positive ones. Perhaps even more valuable: it's hard to repeat a brilliant performance, but it's straightforward to avoid errors. [9]

The other reason it's hard to start a company before 23 is that people won't take you seriously. VCs won't trust you, and will try to reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding. Customers will worry you're going to flake out and leave them stranded. Even you yourself, unless you're very unusual, will feel your age to some degree; you'll find it awkward to be the boss of someone much older than you, and if you're 21, hiring only people younger rather limits your options.

Some people could probably start a company at 18 if they wanted to. Bill Gates was 19 when he and Paul Allen started Microsoft. (Paul Allen was 22, though, and that probably made a difference.) So if you're thinking, I don't care what he says, I'm going to start a company now, you may be the sort of person who could get away with it.

The other cutoff, 38, has a lot more play in it. One reason I put it there is that I don't think many people have the physical stamina much past that age. I used to work till 2:00 or 3:00 AM every night, seven days a week. I don't know if I could do that now.

Also, startups are a big risk financially. If you try something that blows up and leaves you broke at 26, big deal; a lot of 26 year olds are broke. By 38 you can't take so many risks-- especially if you have kids.

My final test may be the most restrictive. Do you actually want to start a startup? What it amounts to, economically, is compressing your working life into the smallest possible space. Instead of working at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for four. And maybe end up with nothing-- though in that case it probably won't take four years.

During this time you'll do little but work, because when you're not working, your competitors will be. My only leisure activities were running, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, and about fifteen minutes of reading a night. I had a girlfriend for a total of two months during that three year period. Every couple weeks I would take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a friend's house for dinner. I went to visit my family twice. Otherwise I just worked.

Working was often fun, because the people I worked with were some of my best friends. Sometimes it was even technically interesting. But only about 10% of the time. The best I can say for the other 90% is that some of it is funnier in hindsight than it seemed then. Like the time the power went off in Cambridge for about six hours, and we made the mistake of trying to start a gasoline powered generator inside our offices. I won't try that again.

I don't think the amount of bullshit you have to deal with in a startup is more than you'd endure in an ordinary working life. It's probably less, in fact; it just seems like a lot because it's compressed into a short period. So mainly what a startup buys you is time. That's the way to think about it if you're trying to decide whether to start one. If you're the sort of person who would like to solve the money problem once and for all instead of working for a salary for 40 years, then a startup makes sense.

For a lot of people the conflict is between startups and graduate school. Grad students are just the age, and just the sort of people, to start software startups. You may worry that if you do you'll blow your chances of an academic career. But it's possible to be part of a startup and stay in grad school, especially at first. Two of our three original hackers were in grad school the whole time, and both got their degrees. There are few sources of energy so powerful as a procrastinating grad student.

If you do have to leave grad school, in the worst case it won't be for too long. If a startup fails, it will probably fail quickly enough that you can return to academic life. And if it succeeds, you may find you no longer have such a burning desire to be an assistant professor.

If you want to do it, do it. Starting a startup is not the great mystery it seems from outside. It's not something you have to know about "business" to do. Build something users love, and spend less than you make. How hard is that?

Notes

[1] Google's revenues are about two billion a year, but half comes from ads on other sites.

[2] One advantage startups have over established companies is that there are no discrimination laws about starting businesses. For example, I would be reluctant to start a startup with a woman who had small children, or was likely to have them soon. But you're not allowed to ask prospective employees if they plan to have kids soon. Believe it or not, under current US law, you're not even allowed to discriminate on the basis of intelligence. Whereas when you're starting a company, you can discriminate on any basis you want about who you start it with.

[3] Learning to hack is a lot cheaper than business school, because you can do it mostly on your own. For the price of a Linux box, a copy of K&R, and a few hours of advice from your neighbor's fifteen year old son, you'll be well on your way.

[4] Corollary: Avoid starting a startup to sell things to the biggest company of all, the government. Yes, there are lots of opportunities to sell them technology. But let someone else start those startups.

[5] A friend who started a company in Germany told me they do care about the paperwork there, and that there's more of it. Which helps explain why there are not more startups in Germany.

[6] At the seed stage our valuation was in principle $100,000, because Julian got 10% of the company. But this is a very misleading number, because the money was the least important of the things Julian gave us.

[7] The same goes for companies that seem to want to acquire you. There will be a few that are only pretending to in order to pick your brains. But you can never tell for sure which these are, so the best approach is to seem entirely open, but to fail to mention a few critical technical secrets.

[8] I was as bad an employee as this place was a company. I apologize to anyone who had to work with me there.
