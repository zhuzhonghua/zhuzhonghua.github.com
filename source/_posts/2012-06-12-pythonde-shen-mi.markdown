<a href="http://www.paulgrahamcn.com/article/pypar">Python的神秘</a>

Python悖论——计算机也有方言？

在最近一次访谈中，我有个说法让很多人不爽：开发Python项目的程序员比搞Java项目的聪明。

我可不是说Java程序员就笨。我只是说Python程序员聪明。学一门新的编程语言费时费力。学Python的人绝不是为了找工作才学的，而是因为他们打心底里就喜欢编程，又不满意已经会的语言。

这正是那种公司需要的程序员。我找不到贴切地说法，姑且称之为Python悖论：如果一家公司刻意采用深奥的语言编程，就能招到更优秀的程序员，因为只有真心实意学编程语言的人才会来应聘。对于程序员，这个悖论更是显而易见：要想找个好工作，就要学一种不是仅仅为了找工作的语言。

迄今为止，只有少数几家聪明的公司意识到了这一点。但它们现在的确也用这种选拔方式：这些公司恰恰是程序员们趋之若鹜的。例如谷歌。发布Java编程招聘的时候，他们也要求有Python的经验。

我有个朋友，常用的语言几乎没有他不会的，但大部分项目他都用Python。他说，最主要的原因是喜欢其源代码。这种选择语言的理由貌似很无聊。不过还是有点道理的：编程的时候，读代码花的时间比写代码多。你堆砌源代码的方式就像雕塑家堆粘土一样。粘土里疙瘩太多，雕塑家就会抓狂，源代码太烂，严谨的程序员也会发疯。

说到源代码太烂，人们自然就会想到Perl。不过我所指的不是Perl那种肤浅的烂。句法僵化算不上真烂，基于错误概念编程才令人痛不欲生。Perl就像是卡通娃娃口吐秽语，但它也有Python所不及的理念。

点到为止。这两种语言当然都在发展。但它们，以及Ruby (还有Icon、Joy、J、Lisp和Smalltalk)，都有一个共同点，创造它们、使用它们的人都是真正关心编程的人。而这些人往往是编程高手。

================================

August 2004 In a recent talk I said something that upset a lot of people: that you could get smarter programmers to work on a Python project than you could to work on a Java project.

I didn't mean by this that Java programmers are dumb. I meant that Python programmers are smart. It's a lot of work to learn a new programming language. And people don't learn Python because it will get them a job; they learn it because they genuinely like to program and aren't satisfied with the languages they already know.

Which makes them exactly the kind of programmers companies should want to hire. Hence what, for lack of a better name, I'll call the Python paradox: if a company chooses to write its software in a comparatively esoteric language, they'll be able to hire better programmers, because they'll attract only those who cared enough to learn it. And for programmers the paradox is even more pronounced: the language to learn, if you want to get a good job, is a language that people don't learn merely to get a job.

Only a few companies have been smart enough to realize this so far. But there is a kind of selection going on here too: they're exactly the companies programmers would most like to work for. Google, for example. When they advertise Java programming jobs, they also want Python experience.

A friend of mine who knows nearly all the widely used languages uses Python for most of his projects. He says the main reason is that he likes the way source code looks. That may seem a frivolous reason to choose one language over another. But it is not so frivolous as it sounds: when you program, you spend more time reading code than writing it. You push blobs of source code around the way a sculptor does blobs of clay. So a language that makes source code ugly is maddening to an exacting programmer, as clay full of lumps would be to a sculptor.

At the mention of ugly source code, people will of course think of Perl. But the superficial ugliness of Perl is not the sort I mean. Real ugliness is not harsh-looking syntax, but having to build programs out of the wrong concepts. Perl may look like a cartoon character swearing, but there are cases where it surpasses Python conceptually.

So far, anyway. Both languages are of course moving targets. But they share, along with Ruby (and Icon, and Joy, and J, and Lisp, and Smalltalk) the fact that they're created by, and used by, people who really care about programming. And those tend to be the ones who do it well.
