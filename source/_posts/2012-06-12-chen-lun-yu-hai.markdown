<a href="http://www.paulgrahamcn.com/article/addiction">沉沦欲海</a>

（坠入诱惑的怀抱，真容易；而且，坠落的过程应该加速吧？）

烈酒、香烟、海洛因和可卡因的共同点：比以前的东西，令人更加容易上瘾。这类东西即使不是全部、也大部分属于令人上瘾之物。而且，令人担忧的是，制造这类东西的过程正在加速。

我们不想停下来。这也是治疗疾病的过程：技术进步。技术进步的后果，比我们想要的多。当如愿时，我们觉得技术进步是一个好东西。如果新技术能提高太阳能电池几个百分点，那就更好了。当技术进步事与愿违时——如从鸦片中提炼出海洛因——那可就是坏东西了。但过程是一样的。

没人怀疑这过程正在加速；意味着：我们现在喜欢的许多事物，最终会让我们沉湎其中。

目前，我不知道该如何形容那些我们过于沉迷的事物。最近似的词要算“成瘾”吧。在我的生活中，该词的用法越来越普遍了。原因清晰：我们得用这个词，来形容越来越多的事情。极端的例子是可卡因和甲安菲他命。集约饲养和花样翻新的加工，快速做出食品上架，你可以在美国各个城镇看到制成品。“魔兽世界”和“法姆维尔”代替了棋盘格和单人棋牌游戏；电视节目够厉害吧，可还是打不过Facebook。

比起40年前，这世道越来越沉迷各种事物了。除非这类技术进步受制于各项法律，这世道接下来的40年，会比过去的40年更沉迷。

未来40年将有一些很棒的东西。我没有逃避的意思。酒精是一味危险的药物，但我宁愿生活的世界里有酒。许多人能与酒相安无事；但必须小心。我们喜欢的东西越多，意味要小心的东西越多。

不幸的是，许多人做不到。当世界变得越来越沉迷的时候，正常生活的两种思路会更加分裂了。一种“正常”是统计意义上的：别人都在做的事情。另一种是“正常”处理事情：这最有效。

这两种想法已经非常分裂了。在美国大部分地方，那些尝试过简朴生活的人，已经看起来象怪物了。这个趋势会越来越明显。从现在开始，可以用一个简单粗暴的原则：如果别人不认为你古怪，那么你的日子就糟糕了。

社会最终会对新的成瘾事物产生抗体。我亲眼看见香烟的变迁。香烟刚出现时，就象传染病一样，在各个人群中传播。吸烟很快变成一件正常的事情（统计上的）。到处都有烟灰缸。当我小的时候，即使我父母不吸烟，家里也为客人准备了烟灰缸。

随着吸烟有害健康的知识普及，民风为之一变。过去20年，吸烟从一件看起来完全正常的事情，变成了肮脏的坏习惯；从电影明星当众吞云吐雾，到一小群瘾君子挤在办公楼外过瘾。当然，很大程度上要归功法律，但如果民风尚未改变之前，法律是不会出台的。

但这需要时间——大概100年吧。社会产生抗体的速度，如果比不上技术进步甩出新诱惑的速度，那么社会习俗保护我们的能力就越来越弱。如果不想成为新诱惑的祭品——为后代提供伤心的例子——我们就得靠自己——明白逃离的对象和方法。真正明智的办法（或较明智的办法）是：怀疑一切新事物。

事实上，这样做还不够。我们不止要担心新玩意，也要考虑已存在的、越来越让人沉迷的事物。这个想法约束了我。我已经躲开许多诱惑了，但互联网绊住了我，当我使用它时，它变得让人着迷了。

我知道很多人网络成瘾。我们都想办法摆脱。如，这就是我不要iPhone的原因；我最不愿意做的事情，就是出门还随身携带互联网。我最新的爱好是远足。我过去认为锻炼方式中，跑步比远足好，因为前者花的时间少。现在，远足的慢悠悠看起来是优点，因为花在小径上的时间越多，不受干扰的思考时间就越多。

听起来很另类吧？当你想解决一些问题，而这些问题还没有约定俗成的解决办法时，都会显得很另类。或许不能以“奥康姆剃刀”为借口；或许，我只是另类。但我肯定，诱惑会越来越多，逃离诱惑的苦苦挣扎将会是每个——要妥当安排生活——人的命运。我们拒绝的事情，将决定我们的生活。

注释：

（1）能将技术进步局限在想要的范围内吗？如果不是警察国家，只能有限度做到。即便如此，各种限制措施还会出现事与愿违的副作用。技术进步中，“好”和“坏”并非泾渭分明，所以人们会发现——拖延了后者，也就拖延了前者。实际情况中，就象《禁酒令》和“打击毒品”，各种限制带来的坏处经常比好处多。

（2）技术一直在加速发展。以旧石器时期的标准，新石器时期的技术进步太快了。

（3）除非我们能批量生产社会习俗。我怀疑，近期美国基督福音的复兴，部分原因是抵制毒品。绝望中，人们拿起了这剂猛药；如果孩子们不听他们的话，或许会听上帝的话。但这剂药的后果，不仅仅是孩子们拒绝了毒品。最后，也会拒绝科学。

我担心，未来只有一小部分人自己寻找穿过荒原的路；而其他人只是跟团旅行。或者更糟，只有政府指定的一条线路。

（4）通常，大家用“拖拖拉拉”形容泡在网上的状态。我觉得只说大家没在工作，简直太客气了。我们就不会说那些醉醺醺、没在工作的人，只是“拖拉”。

（5）有几个人告诉我，有些地方用手提电脑，会很扎眼，他们喜欢iPad，是因为能在这些地方用。换句话说，就一时髦玩意。（当然，这话也可以形容iPhone，但这个优点不明显，因为这东西听起来象手机，况且人人当手机使。）

===========================

The Acceleration of Addictiveness

July 2010

What hard liquor, cigarettes, heroin, and crack have in common is that they're all more concentrated forms of less addictive predecessors. Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are. And the scary thing is, the process that created them is accelerating.

We wouldn't want to stop it. It's the same process that cures diseases: technological progress. Technological progress means making things do more of what we want. When the thing we want is something we want to want, we consider technological progress good. If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that seems strictly better. When progress concentrates something we don't want to want—when it transforms opium into heroin—it seems bad. But it's the same process at work. [1]

No one doubts this process is accelerating, which means increasing numbers of things we like will be transformed into things we like too much. [2]

As far as I know there's no word for something we like too much. The closest is the colloquial sense of "addictive." That usage has become increasingly common during my lifetime. And it's clear why: there are an increasing number of things we need it for. At the extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth. Food has been transformed by a combination of factory farming and innovations in food processing into something with way more immediate bang for the buck, and you can see the results in any town in America. Checkers and solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft and FarmVille. TV has become much more engaging, and even so it can't compete with Facebook.

The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago. And unless the forms of technological progress that produced these things are subject to different laws than technological progress in general, the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did in the last 40.

The next 40 years will bring us some wonderful things. I don't mean to imply they're all to be avoided. Alcohol is a dangerous drug, but I'd rather live in a world with wine than one without. Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be careful. More things we like will mean more things we have to be careful about.

Most people won't, unfortunately. Which means that as the world becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live a normal life will be driven ever further apart. One sense of "normal" is statistically normal: what everyone else does. The other is the sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a piece of machinery: what works best.

These two senses are already quite far apart. Already someone trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of the US. That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced. You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if people don't think you're weird, you're living badly.

Societies eventually develop antibodies to addictive new things. I've seen that happen with cigarettes. When cigarettes first appeared, they spread the way an infectious disease spreads through a previously isolated population. Smoking rapidly became a (statistically) normal thing. There were ashtrays everywhere. We had ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though neither of my parents smoked. You had to for guests.

As knowledge spread about the dangers of smoking, customs changed. In the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed from something that seemed totally normal into a rather seedy habit: from something movie stars did in publicity shots to something small huddles of addicts do outside the doors of office buildings. A lot of the change was due to legislation, of course, but the legislation couldn't have happened if customs hadn't already changed.

It took a while though—on the order of 100 years. And unless the rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match the accelerating rate at which technological progress throws off new addictions, we'll be increasingly unable to rely on customs to protect us. [3] Unless we want to be canaries in the coal mine of each new addiction—the people whose sad example becomes a lesson to future generations—we'll have to figure out for ourselves what to avoid and how. It will actually become a reasonable strategy (or a more reasonable strategy) to suspect everything new.

In fact, even that won't be enough. We'll have to worry not just about new things, but also about existing things becoming more addictive. That's what bit me. I've avoided most addictions, but the Internet got me because it became addictive while I was using it. [4]

Most people I know have problems with Internet addiction. We're all trying to figure out our own customs for getting free of it. That's why I don't have an iPhone, for example; the last thing I want is for the Internet to follow me out into the world. [5] My latest trick is taking long hikes. I used to think running was a better form of exercise than hiking because it took less time. Now the slowness of hiking seems an advantage, because the longer I spend on the trail, the longer I have to think without interruption.

Sounds pretty eccentric, doesn't it? It always will when you're trying to solve problems where there are no customs yet to guide you. Maybe I can't plead Occam's razor; maybe I'm simply eccentric. But if I'm right about the acceleration of addictiveness, then this kind of lonely squirming to avoid it will increasingly be the fate of anyone who wants to get things done. We'll increasingly be defined by what we say no to.

Notes

[1] Could you restrict technological progress to areas where you wanted it? Only in a limited way, without becoming a police state. And even then your restrictions would have undesirable side effects. "Good" and "bad" technological progress aren't sharply differentiated, so you'd find you couldn't slow the latter without also slowing the former. And in any case, as Prohibition and the "war on drugs" show, bans often do more harm than good.

[2] Technology has always been accelerating. By Paleolithic standards, technology evolved at a blistering pace in the Neolithic period.

[3] Unless we mass produce social customs. I suspect the recent resurgence of evangelical Christianity in the US is partly a reaction to drugs. In desperation people reach for the sledgehammer; if their kids won't listen to them, maybe they'll listen to God. But that solution has broader consequences than just getting kids to say no to drugs. You end up saying no to science as well.

I worry we may be heading for a future in which only a few people plot their own itinerary through no-land, while everyone else books a package tour. Or worse still, has one booked for them by the government.

[4] People commonly use the word "procrastination" to describe what they do on the Internet. It seems to me too mild to describe what's happening as merely not-doing-work. We don't call it procrastination when someone gets drunk instead of working.

[5] Several people have told me they like the iPad because it lets them bring the Internet into situations where a laptop would be too conspicuous. In other words, it's a hip flask. (This is true of the iPhone too, of course, but this advantage isn't as obvious because it reads as a phone, and everyone's used to those.)
