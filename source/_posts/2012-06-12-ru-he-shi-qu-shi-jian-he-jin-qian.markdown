<a href="http://www.paulgrahamcn.com/article/selfindulgence">如何失去时间和金钱</a>

2010年7月

1998年我们卖掉了自己的创业公司，突然间我有了很多钱。现在我不得不考虑一些以前从未考虑过的事情：如何避免失去这些钱。我知道人有可能由穷变富，也有可能由富变穷。过去几年我一直在研究由穷变富的方法，但我对如何由富变穷几乎一无所知。现在，为了避免由富变穷，我必须找出由富变穷的理由。

所以我开始注意财富是如何失去的。如果当我还是个孩子时你问我富人怎样才会变穷，我肯定会说把钱花掉。书里和电影里都是这些说的，因为这是最明显的方法。但实际上，大部分财富通常不是通过过度消费失去的，而是通过失败的投资。

你很难在毫不留意的情况下花掉一大笔钱。如果你花掉了几万块钱，很有可能会想“哇，我在花掉很多钱”。但如果你从事金融衍生品交易，一眨眼的工夫你就可能失去几百万美元（真的，你想赚多少就有可能赔多少）。

在大部分人看来，花钱购买奢侈品会给自己敲响警钟，而进行失败的投资则不会。买奢侈品看上去是自我放纵。除非你的钱是继承的家产或中彩票得来的，否则你已经很清楚自我放纵会带来麻烦。也正因为如此，很多人在向你推销奢侈品时会说“这是一笔投资”。

解决办法是建立新的警钟。这可能比较麻烦，因为阻止你过度消费的警钟非常基础，甚至它们有可能存在于我们的DNA里，而阻止你进行失败投资的警钟则需要学习，并且有时它们是非常违背直觉的。

几天前，我有一些惊人的发现：时间和金钱面临的情况非常类似。浪费时间最危险的办法不是花时间去享乐，而是花时间假装工作。当你花时间享乐时，你知道你在放纵自己。你的警钟很快就会敲响。如果我早上起来，坐在沙发上看一天电视，我会感到非常不舒服。想一想我都不寒而栗。坐在沙发上看两个小时的电视我都会感到不自在，更别说一整天了。

但我有时候的确会在电视前面坐一天，到一天结束的时候，如果我问自己当天做了什么，答案会是：几乎什么都没做。这样的一天过去后我也会不自在，但和坐在沙发上看一天电视那种感觉不一样。如果我看一整天电视，我会觉得我正在走向堕落。但是当我过完一事无成的一天之后，同样的警钟不会响起，因为从表面上看，我做的那些事情像是真正的工作，比如处理电子邮件。我坐在桌子旁边处理邮件，这并非享乐，那么这肯定是工作。

时间和金钱一样，避免享乐已经无法保护你。这种方法对于保护那些靠打猎采集为生的人或前工业化社会有用。先天因素和后天因素加在一起会让人们避开自我放纵。但是这个世界变得越来越复杂：现在最危险的陷阱是那些看似更加正经，从而可以绕开自我放纵警钟的新型行为。更糟糕的是，这些行为并不会带来乐趣。

How To Lose Time And Money

July 2010

When we sold our startup in 1998 I suddenly got a lot of money. I now had to think about something I hadn't had to think about before: how not to lose it. I knew it was possible to go from rich to poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich. But while I'd spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from poor to rich, I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich to poor. Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they were.

So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost. If you'd asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have said by spending all their money. That's how it happens in books and movies, because that's the colorful way to do it. But in fact the way most fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through bad investments.

It's hard to spend a fortune without noticing. Someone with ordinary tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of thousands of dollars without thinking "wow, I'm spending a lot of money." Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an eye.

In most people's minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments doesn't. Luxuries seem self-indulgent. And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery, you've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads to trouble. Investing bypasses those alarms. You're not spending the money; you're just moving it from one asset to another. Which is why people trying to sell you expensive things say "it's an investment."

The solution is to develop new alarms. This can be a tricky business, because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes fairly counterintuitive.

A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with time is much the same as with money. The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work. When you spend time having fun, you know you're being self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly. If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd feel like something was terribly wrong. Just thinking about it makes me wince. I'd start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.

And yet I've definitely had days when I might as well have sat in front of a TV all day—days at the end of which, if I asked myself what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically, nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad as I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV. If I spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was descending into perdition. But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work. Dealing with email, for example. You do it sitting at a desk. It's not fun. So it must be work.

With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to protect you. It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers, and perhaps all pre-industrial societies. So nature and nurture combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more virtuous types. And the worst thing is, they're not even fun.
